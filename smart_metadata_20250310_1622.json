[{"pmid": "38864362", "title": "Interventions to increase time spent outdoors for preventing incidence and progression of myopia in children.", "abstract": "Myopia or nearsightedness is a type of refractive error. It causes people to see near objects clearly but distant objects as blurred. Good vision can be obtained if the refractive error is corrected properly but, where this is not possible, impaired vision will remain. The remaining myopia imposes a considerable personal and societal burden. In addition, the progression of myopia is more likely to be accompanied by other ocular diseases such as cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Myopia has emerged as a significant global public health problem in recent years. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported uncorrected or undercorrected myopia to be a major cause of visual impairment worldwide. From both an individual and social perspective, it is important to prevent the onset of myopia and slow down its progression. Observational studies have shown that children who spend more time outdoors have a lower incidence of myopia. Several other non-Cochrane systematic reviews have focused on the association between increasing children's outdoor activity time and the prevention of myopia. However, none of these systematic reviews were limited to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), as they included all types of study designs, including observational studies and non-RCTs, in addition to RCTs. To assess the effects of interventions to increase outdoor time on the incidence and progression of myopia in children. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP with no language restrictions. The databases were last searched on 24 June 2022. We included RCTs and cluster-RCTs in which interventions were performed to increase the outdoor time for children with the aim of preventing the incidence and progression of myopia. We employed the standard methods recommended by Cochrane and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We considered the following outcome measures: mean change in refractive error from baseline, incidence of myopia, mean change in the axial length from baseline, mean change in unaided distance visual acuity from baseline, quality of life and adverse event. We included five RCTs in this review, four of which were cluster-RCTs. The total number of participants was 10,733. The included participants were primary school children, most of whom were in first or second grade (aged six to nine years). Four cluster-RCTs involved school-based interventions to encourage children to spend more time outdoors. The interventions included classroom time outdoors, routine for spending recess outdoors, motivational tools for spending time outdoors, and encouragement through electronic information tools. The intervention groups had less change in refractive errors in the direction of myopia; however, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included no benefit or both benefit and harm at years one and three, and differences at year two included both clinically important and unimportant benefits (at 1 year: mean difference (MD) 0.08 dioptres (D), 95% CI -0.01 to 0.17; 4 studies, 1656 participants; low-certainty evidence; at 2 years: MD 0.13 D, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.19; 4 studies, 2454 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; at 3 years: MD 0.17 D, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.51; 1 study, 729 participants; low-certainty evidence). Our protocol defined a difference of 0.1 D in the change in refractive error as clinically important. At one year, the difference was less than 0.1 D, but at two and three years it was more than 0.1 D. The incidence of myopia was lower in the intervention groups compared to the control groups, but 95% CIs included no change or clinically unimportant benefits (at 1 year: 7.1% with intervention versus 9.5% with control; risk ratio (RR), 0.82, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19; 3 studies, 1265 participants; low-certainty evidence; at 2 years: 22.5% with intervention versus 26.7% with control; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.98; 3 studies, 2104 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; at 3 years: 30.5% with intervention versus 39.8% with control; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.01; 1 study, 394 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Our protocol defined a difference of 3% in the incidence of myopia as clinically important. At one year, the difference was 2.4%, but there were clinically important differences between the two groups at two (4.2%) and three years (9.3%). The intervention groups had smaller changes in axial lengths in the direction of myopia than the control groups; however, 95% CIs included no benefit or both benefit and harm at years one and three (at 1 year: MD -0.04 mm, 95% CI -0.09 to 0; 3 studies, 1666 participants; low-certainty evidence; at 2 years: MD -0.04 mm, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01; 3 studies, 2479 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; at 3 years: MD -0.03 mm, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.07; 1 study, 763 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No included studies reported changes in unaided distance visual acuity and quality of life. No adverse events were reported. The intervention methods varied from adopting outdoor activities as part of school lessons to providing information and motivation for encouraging outdoor activities. The results of this review suggest that long-term interventions to increase the time spent outdoors may potentially reduce the development of myopia in children. However, although the interventions may also suppress the progression of myopia, the low certainty of evidence makes it difficult to draw conclusions.

Although intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is an effective treatment option that helps to prevent vision loss or to improve visual acuity in people with neovascular AMD, treatment imposes a significant financial burden on patients and healthcare systems. A biosimilar is a biological product that has been developed to be nearly identical to a previously approved biological product. The use of biosimilars may help reduce costs and so may increase patient access to effective biologic medicines with similar levels of safety to the drugs on which they are based. To assess the benefits and harms of anti-VEGF biosimilar agents compared with their corresponding anti-VEGF agents (i.e. the reference products) that have obtained regulatory approval for intravitreal injections in people with neovascular AMD. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registries together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was 2 June 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared approved anti-VEGF biosimilars with their reference products for treating the eyes of adult participants (\u2265 50 years) who had an active primary or recurrent choroidal neovascularization lesion secondary to neovascular AMD. Our outcomes were: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), vision-related quality of life, serious ocular and non-ocular adverse events (AE), treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), and serum concentrations of biosimilars and reference drugs. We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for seven outcomes reported in a summary of findings table by using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We synthesized results for each outcome using meta-analysis, where possible, by calculating risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. Where this was not possible due to the nature of the data, we summarized the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes. We included nine parallel-group multi-center RCTs that enrolled a total of 3814 participants (3814 participating eyes), with sample sizes that ranged from 160 to 705 participants per study. The mean age of the participants in these studies ranged from 67 to 76 years, and the proportion of women ranged from 26.5% to 58.7%. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) was the reference product in seven studies, and aflibercept (Eyelea) was the reference product in two others. All the included studies had been supported by industry. The follow-up periods ranged from 12 to 52 weeks (median 48 weeks). Five studies (56%) were conducted in multi-country settings across Europe, North America and Asia, two studies in India, and one each in Japan and the Republic of Korea. We judged all the included studies to have met high methodological standards. With regard to efficacy, our meta-analyses demonstrated that anti-VEGF biosimilars for neovascular AMD resulted in little to no difference compared with the reference products for BCVA change at 8 to 12 weeks (MD -0.55 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, 95% CI -1.17 to 0.07; 8 studies, 3603 participants; high-certainty evidence) and the proportion of participants who lost fewer than 15 letters in BCVA at 24 to 48 weeks (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01; 7 studies, 2658 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Almost all participants (96.6% in the biosimilar group and 97.0% in the reference product group) lost fewer than 15 letters in BCVA. The evidence from two studies suggested that there was no evidence of difference between biosimilars and reference products in vision-related quality of life measured by the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) summary scores at 24 to 48 weeks (MD 0.82, 95% CI -0.70 to 2.35; 2 studies, 894 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). With regard to the safety profile, meta-analyses also revealed little to no difference between anti-VEGF biosimilars and the reference products for the proportion of participants who experienced serious ocular AEs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.26; 7 studies, 3292 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and for TEAEs leading to investigational product discontinuation or death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.46; 8 studies, 3497 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Overall, 1.4% of participants in the biosimilar group and 1.2% in the reference product group experienced serious ocular adverse events. The most frequently documented serious ocular AEs were retinal hemorrhage and endophthalmitis. Although the evidence is of low certainty due to imprecision, meta-analysis suggested that anti-VEGF biosimilars led to no difference compared with the reference products for cumulative incidence of ADAs (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.22; 8 studies, 3066 participants; low-certainty evidence) or mean maximum serum concentrations (MD 0.42 ng/mL, 95% CI -0.22 to 1.05; subgroup of 3 studies, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). We judged the overall risk of bias to be low for all studies. In our review, low to high certainty evidence suggests that there is little to no difference, to date, between the anti-VEGF biosimilars approved for treating neovascular AMD and their reference products in terms of benefits and harms. While anti-VEGF biosimilars may be a viable alternative to reference products, current evidence for their use is based on a limited number of studies - particularly for comparison with aflibercept - with sparse long-term safety data, and infrequent assessment of quality of life outcomes. Our effect estimates and conclusions may be modified once findings have been reported from studies that are currently ongoing, and studies of biosimilar agents that are currently in development.

However, a number of complications can occur during and after vitrectomy for PDR. These include bleeding and the creation of retinal holes during surgery, and bleeding, retinal detachment and scar tissue on the retina after surgery. These complications can limit vision, require further surgery and delay recovery. The use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents injected into the eye before surgery has been proposed to reduce the occurrence of these complications. Anti-VEGF agents can reduce the amount and vascularity of abnormal new vessels associated with PDR, facilitating their dissection during surgery, reducing intra- and postoperative bleeding, and potentially improving outcomes. To assess the effects of perioperative anti-VEGF use on the outcomes of vitrectomy for\u00a0the treatment of complications for proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; the ISRCTN registry; ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. The date of the search was 22 June 2022. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that looked at the use of anti-VEGFs and the incidence of complications in people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR. \u00a0 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The critical outcomes of the review were the mean difference in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between study arms at six (\u00b1 three) months after the primary vitrectomy, the incidence of early postoperative vitreous cavity haemorrhage (POVCH, within four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of late POVCH (occurring more than four weeks postoperatively), the incidence of revision surgery for POVCH within six months, the incidence of revision surgery for recurrent traction/macular pucker of any type and/or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within six months and vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) measures. Important outcomes included the proportion of people with a visual acuity of counting fingers (1.8 logMAR or worse), the number of operative retinal breaks reported and the frequency of silicone oil tamponade required at time of surgery. The current review includes 28 RCTs that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal anti-VEGFs to improve the outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (11 from China, three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Mexico and the remaining studies from South Korea, the UK, Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Pakistan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were the well-recognised complications of proliferative retinopathy: non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 1914 eyes.\u00a0 We identified methodological issues in all of the included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators, and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation. Participants receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF in addition to pars plana vitrectomy achieved better BCVA at six months compared to people undergoing vitrectomy alone (mean difference (MD) -0.25 logMAR, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.39 to -0.11; 13 studies, 699 eyes; low-certainty evidence). Pre- or intraoperative anti-VEGF reduced the incidence of early POVCH (12% versus 31%, risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.58; 14 studies, 1038 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Perioperative anti-VEGF use was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of late POVCH (10% versus 23%, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74; 11 studies, 579 eyes; high-certainty evidence). The need for revision surgery for POVCH occurred less frequently in the anti-VEGF group compared with control, but the confidence intervals were wide and compatible with no effect (4% versus 13%, RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.28; 4 studies 207 eyes; moderate-certainty evidence). Similar imprecisely measured effects were seen for revision surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5% versus 11%, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.66; 4 studies, 145 eyes; low-certainty evidence).\u00a0 Anti-VEGFs reduce the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks (12% versus 31%, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59; 12 studies, 915 eyes; high-certainty evidence) and the need for silicone oil (19% versus 41%, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.80; 10 studies, 591 eyes; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available on quality of life outcomes or the proportion of participants with visual acuity of counting fingers or worse. The perioperative use of anti-VEGF reduces the risk of late POVCH, probably results in lower early POVCH risk and may improve visual outcomes. It also reduces the incidence of intraoperative retinal breaks. The evidence is very uncertain about its effect on the need for silicone oil tamponade. The reported complications from its use appear to be low.

Deficiency of endothelial NOS (eNOS) suppresses retinal but not choroidal neovascularization, whereas deficiency of neuronal NOS (nNOS) or inducible NOS (iNOS) suppresses choroidal, but not retinal neovascularization. In this study, we investigated the effect of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a nonspecific NOS inhibitor, in three models of ocular neovascularization. Oral administration of L-NMMA caused significant inhibition of choroidal neovascularization in mice with laser-induced rupture of Bruch's membrane and significantly inhibited subretinal neovascularization in transgenic mice with expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in photoreceptors (rho/VEGF mice) but did not inhibit retinal neovascularization in mice with ischemic retinopathy. By extensive mating among mice deficient in NOS isoforms, triple homozygous mutant mice deficient in all three NOS isoforms were produced. These mice had marked suppression of choroidal neovascularization at sites of rupture of Bruch's membrane and near-complete suppression of subretinal neovascularization in rho/VEGF mice but showed no difference in ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization compared with wild-type mice.

The V group had the best visual acuity (0.12\u00b10.09) compared to the P group (0.39\u00b10.45) and I group (0.92\u00b10.42). Improved visual acuity was strongly correlated with less disrupted IS/OS and ELM. Intact photoreceptor integrity was linked to preserved IS/OS and ELM, thinner CMT, and shorter CNV height before treatment. However, photoreceptor integrity was not significantly correlated with CMT, RPE regularity, or ONL thickness at the final examination, suggesting it may be independently affected by nAMD. Final visual acuity in nAMD patients post-treatment was strongly linked to foveal photoreceptor integrity. Photoreceptor integrity correlated with initial visual acuity, CMT, ELM integrity, CNV height, and IS/OS layer integrity.

This updated review aimed to summarise the effects of anti-VEGF use to reduce the occurrence of POVCH after vitrectomy surgery for PDR.

We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 26 May 2015. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that looked at the use of anti-VEGFs and the incidence of POVCH in people undergoing vitrectomy for PDR. Both review authors independently assessed and extracted the data. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.The primary outcomes of the review were the incidence of early and late POVCH following perioperative anti-VEGF administration. Secondary outcomes included best-corrected visual acuity at six months following surgery, the incidence of vitreous cavity washout or revision vitrectomy at six months, adverse effects of intervention (cataract, iris rubeosis and rubeotic glaucoma, retinal detachment, increased inflammation and systemic side effects), quality of life measures performed at least six months following vitrectomy, and density of POVCH. The current review included 12 RCTs that looked at the pre- or intraoperative use of intravitreal bevacizumab to prevent postoperative vitreous haemorrhage during pars plana vitrectomy for complications of PDR. The studies were conducted in a variety of countries (three from Iran, two from Italy, two from Egypt, and the remaining from South Korea, USA, Mexico, Pakistan, and Japan). The inclusion criteria for entry into the studies were standard complications of proliferative retinopathy: non-clearing vitreous haemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment involving the macula, or combined tractional rhegmatogenous detachment. The included studies randomised a total of 654 eyes. The average age of the participants was 54 years.We identified methodological issues in all included studies. Risk of bias was highest for masking of participants and investigators (four studies were an 'open label' design), and a number of studies were unclear when describing randomisation methods and sequence allocation.Participants receiving intravitreal bevacizumab in addition to pars plana vitrectomy were less likely to experience early POVCH (grade 2) compared to people undergoing pars plana vitrectomy alone (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.96, 2 studies, 144 eyes, high-quality evidence). This corresponds to an absolute effect of 130 fewer people (95% CI 167 fewer to 7 fewer) with early POVCH per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. We saw similar results for all grades of POVCH (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53, 9 studies, 512 eyes) and when excluding cases where assessment of outcome was impossible due to presence of silicone oil (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60, 6 studies, 302 eyes).The effect of pre- or intraoperative intravitreal bevacizumab on the incidence of late postoperative haemorrhage was uncertain (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.72, 3 studies, 196 eyes, low-quality evidence). The absolute effect was 55 fewer people (95% CI 138 fewer to 143 more) with late POVCH per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. This outcome was rarer and was only reported in a few studies. We are currently unable to provide an estimate of the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on postoperative visual acuity due to significant study heterogeneity.No local or systemic complications of intravitreal bevacizumab were reported by the RCTs. The risk of postoperative retinal detachment was lower in the participants treated with pre- or intraoperative bevacizumab (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.08, 7 studies, 372 participants, low-quality evidence); the absolute effect was 49 fewer people (95% CI:73 fewer to 8 more) with postoperative retinal detachment per 1000 people when treated with intravitreal bevacizumab. The use of pre- or intraoperative bevacizumab lowers the incidence of early POVCH. The reported complications from its use appear to be low.

Here, we provide evidence demonstrating that oxidative stress cooperates with hypoxia to synergistically stimulate the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), resulting in increased expression of the HIF-1-dependent angiogenic mediators that promote CNV. HIF-1 inhibition blocked the expression of these angiogenic mediators and prevented CNV development in an animal model of ocular oxidative stress, demonstrating the pathological role of HIF-1 in response to oxidative stress stimulation in neovascular AMD. While human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived RPE monolayers exposed to chemical oxidants resulted in disorganization and disruption of their normal architecture, RPE cells proved remarkably resistant to oxidative stress. Conversely, equivalent doses of chemical oxidants resulted in apoptosis of hiPSC-derived retinal photoreceptors. Pharmacologic inhibition of HIF-1 in the mouse retina enhanced-while HIF-1 augmentation reduced-photoreceptor apoptosis in two mouse models for oxidative stress, consistent with a protective role for HIF-1 in photoreceptors in patients with advanced dry AMD.

We identified ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (ferroDEGs) by intersecting DEGs with ferroptosis-related genes. Protein-protein interactions network and Cytoscape were used for screening hub genes. Next, we analyzed immune cell infiltration using CIBERSORT and examined the crosstalk between hub ferroDEGs and immune cell infiltration. Hub genes expression in each cell cluster and the proportions of different cell clusters between AMD and normal samples were examined using single-cell data. The hub ferroDEG expressions were verified in cell and mouse models using RT-qPCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence assay. The roles of ANXA1 in ferroptosis and its crosstalk with microglia were investigated. We identified hub ferroDEGs that include six genes (ANXA1, DKK1, CD44, VIM, TGFB2, DUSP1). Functional analysis of those hub ferroDEGs was found to be correlated with leukocyte migration and chemotaxis, macrophage migration, and gliogenesis.

This study examines the global burden and trends in AMD-related low vision and blindness from 1990 to 2021, with projections through 2050. Data were obtained from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2021) study, covering 204 countries and regions. Key metrics, including the prevalent case numbers, annual disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardized prevalence rates (ASPR), and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDALYR), specific to low vision and blindness due to AMD, were calculated per 100,000 population. Trend analysis used the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) method, and K-means clustering identified regions with similar burdens and trends. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing(ES) models provided future projections. Globally, the total number of prevalent cases and DALYs has substantially increased. The number of prevalent cases of low vision and blindness due to AMD increased from 3,640,180 (95% UI: 3,037,098\u2009-\u20094,353,902) in 1990 to 8,057,521 (95% UI: 6,705,284-9,823,238) in 2021. DALYs increased from 302,902 (95% UI: 206,475\u2009-\u2009421,952) in 1990 to 578,020 (95% UI: 401,241-797,570) in 2021. From 1990 to 2021, both the ASPR and ASDALYR for AMD-related low vision and blindness showed a downward trend. The ASPR was 94 (95% UI: 78.32-114.42) per 100,000 population, with an EAPC of -0.26 (95% CI: -0.31 to -0.22), and the ASDALYR was 6.78 (95% UI: 4.7-9.32) per 100,000 population, with an EAPC of -0.94 (95% CI: -1.01 to -0.88). The disease burden of AMD-related low vision and blindness increases with age, and the burden for female patients is slightly higher than for males. Regional stratification by the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) shows that the burden of AMD-related low vision and blindness in areas with low SDI is higher than in areas with high SDI. From 1990 to 2021, notable increases in ASPR and ASDALYR were observed mainly in the southern and central regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the increases in prevalence and DALYs vary by region, country, and level of socioeconomic development. The ARIMA model predicts that by 2050, the number of prevalent cases of low vision and blindness due to AMD will reach 13,880,610(95% CI: 9,805,575-17,955,645), and the DALYs will be 764,731(95% CI: 683,535-845,926).

This study indicates that between 1990 and 2021, the global prevalent cases and DALYs caused by AMD-related low vision and blindness have increased over the past three decades, correlating with factors such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and geographical location. Predictive models indicate that as the population ages, the number of patients with low vision and blindness due to AMD, along with associated DALYs, will continue to rise. By 2050, it is expected that over 9\u00a0million people worldwide will be affected by AMD-related vision loss, with women being particularly impacted.

A literature review was conducted to examine the expression of Scg3 in intraocular neovascular diseases. We reviewed studies on the interaction of Scg3 with its homologous receptors and its effect on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability-key processes involved in angiogenesis and neovascularization. Scg3 was found to be upregulated in the tissues affected by diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and choroidal neovascularization. In DR, Scg3 expression was linked to retinal neovascularization, where it facilitated endothelial cell proliferation and migration, essential processes for the formation of new blood vessels. Similarly, in ROP, Scg3 was associated with fibrovascular tissue proliferation within avascular retinal zones, contributing to the pathological neovascularization seen in premature infants. In the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Scg3 appeared to play a role in choroidal neovascularization, where it promoted the invasion of choroidal capillaries into the retinal pigment epithelium. Furthermore, Scg3's binding to its homologous receptors was shown to enhance vascular permeability, potentially exacerbating fluid leakage and edema in these diseases, which is a hallmark of exudative conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that Scg3 plays a pivotal role in driving angiogenesis and vascular permeability in intraocular neovascular diseases CONCLUSION: The upregulation of Scg3 in DR, ROP, and choroidal neovascularization highlights its potential as a novel therapeutic target.

Initially characterized by an accumulation of sub-RPE deposits, AMD leads to progressive retinal degeneration, and in advanced cases, irreversible vision loss. Although genetic analysis, animal models, and cell culture systems have yielded important insights into AMD, the molecular pathways underlying AMD's onset and progression remain poorly delineated. We sought to better understand the molecular underpinnings of this devastating disease by performing the first comparative transcriptome analysis of AMD and normal human donor eyes. RPE-choroid and retina tissue samples were obtained from a common cohort of 31 normal, 26 AMD, and 11 potential pre-AMD human donor eyes. Transcriptome profiles were generated for macular and extramacular regions, and statistical and bioinformatic methods were employed to identify disease-associated gene signatures and functionally enriched protein association networks. Selected genes of high significance were validated using an independent donor cohort. We identified over 50 annotated genes enriched in cell-mediated immune responses that are globally over-expressed in RPE-choroid AMD phenotypes. Using a machine learning model and a second donor cohort, we show that the top 20 global genes are predictive of AMD clinical diagnosis. We also discovered functionally enriched gene sets in the RPE-choroid that delineate the advanced AMD phenotypes, neovascular AMD and geographic atrophy. Moreover, we identified a graded increase of transcript levels in the retina related to wound response, complement cascade, and neurogenesis that strongly correlates with decreased levels of phototransduction transcripts and increased AMD severity. Based on our findings, we assembled protein-protein interactomes that highlight functional networks likely to be involved in AMD pathogenesis. We discovered new global biomarkers and gene expression signatures of AMD. These results are consistent with a model whereby cell-based inflammatory responses represent a central feature of AMD etiology, and depending on genetics, environment, or stochastic factors, may give rise to the advanced AMD phenotypes characterized by angiogenesis and/or cell death.

In this study we developed an optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging based spatio-temporal reference frame to characterize the morphologic progression of intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to identify distinctive patterns of conversion to the advanced stages macular neovascularization (MNV) and macular atrophy (MA). We included 10,040 OCT volumes of 518 eyes with intermediate AMD acquired according to a standardized protocol in monthly intervals over two years. Two independent masked retina specialists determined the time of conversion to MNV or MA. All scans were aligned to a common reference frame by intra-patient and inter-patient registration. Automated segmentations of retinal layers and the choroid were computed and en-face maps were transformed into the common reference frame. Population maps were constructed in the subgroups converting to MNV (n=135), MA (n=50) and in non-progressors (n=333).

We employed oxidative stressors, menadione (VK3) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and observed a reduction of LAMTOR1 in both human and mouse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) following short-term (1h) and prolonged exposures (24h). Nrf2 overexpression increased both lamtor1 mRNA and LAMTOR1 protein in the RPE. To determine if Nrf2 regulates lamtor1 transcription, we cloned the deletion mutants of the lamtor1 promoter into a luciferase reporter. Although the promoter contained antioxidant response elements, transcriptional activity depended on the interaction between Nrf2 and the constructs containing the transcriptional start site. Moreover, Nrf2-driven transcription was significantly reduced by an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase, p300. Correspondingly, Nrf2 overexpression increased levels of acetylated histone 3 and p300. The reduction in LAMTOR1 by 4-HNE was reversed by pepstatin A and NH", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["menadione (VK3)", "4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)", "pepstatin A", "NH"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "39710334", "title": "The unanticipated contribution of Zap70 in retinal degeneration: Implications for microglial inflammatory activation.", "abstract": "Inflammation is a major mechanism of photoreceptor cell death in the retina during macular degeneration leading to the blindness.

We observed activated microglial cells migrated and populated the retinal layer following blue LED-induced photoreceptor degeneration and activated microglial cells in the LED-injured retina expressed Zap70, unlike the inactive microglial cells in the normal retina. Visual function was considerably decreased in blue-LED light-exposed mice, and animals with Zap70 mutations were adversely affected. Furthermore, extensive photoreceptor cell death was observed in the SKG mice, bearing a Zap70 mutation that induces autoimmune disease. In the blue-LED light-exposed groups, SKG retinas had significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than those in wild-type mice. Furthermore, regulating Zap70 activity has a significant influence on microglial inflammatory state. We discovered that active microglial cells expressing Zap70 could modify vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) signaling in primary retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Our novel study revealed that the production of Zap70 by retinal microglial cells is responsible for inflammatory signals that promote apoptosis in photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, Zap70-positive microglial cells were capable of regulating Vegfa signaling in RPE cells, which matches the hallmark of macular degeneration.

The main advantage of DPSCs is related to their paracrine immunosuppressive and immunoregulatory abilities, including the capability to promote regeneration of damaged tissues. Recent studies demonstrated the therapeutic potential of DPSCs-conditioned media (CM) in neurodegenerative diseases.

In this study we evaluated the capability of DPSCs-CM to counteract retinal degeneration in an animal model of AMD.

We evaluated the retinal function, and we performed morphological and molecular analysis a week after the LD, in accordance with the well-established protocol of our light damage model. DPSCs-CM obtained from hypoxia (HYPO-CM) or normoxia (NORM-CM), were able to preserve the retinal function, to reduce the damaged area and to counteract the upregulation of key factors involved in retinal degeneration, like FGF-2.

We measured the viability of cells obtained from PAL-222, examined cell surface antigens by flow cytometry, measured the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) secretory ability, examined the expression of types I and IV collagen and elastin by immunostaining. We performed a transwell in vitro migration assay to evaluate durability and similarity to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and checked in vitro tumorigenicity. In an in vivo experiment, we transplanted PAL-222 into the subretinal space of RCS rats and evaluated the safety and efficacy. Viability of cells obtained from PAL-222 was 88.1%. The rate of positive markers such as CD90, CD73, CD105 and CD44 exceeded 90%; that of the negative markers such as CD34, CD11b, CD19, CD45 and HLA-DR was less than 2%. PAL-222 secreted significant amounts of VEGF and PEDF and expressed types I and IV collagen and elastin. The migration assay showed that PAL-222 preserved the sheet structure without cell migration. No chromosomal aberration or colony formation was observed in in vitro tumorigenicity tests. PAL-222 transplantation suppressed the progression of retinal degeneration by preserving the outer nuclear layer without negative changes in RCS rats, suggesting a retinoprotective effect.

Chronic CSE altered the metabolic profile in both LR and HR iPSC-RPE and caused a dose-dependent reduction in mitochondrial function despite an increase in mitochondrial content. Notably, cells with the HR CFH SNP showed a greater reduction in maximal respiration and ATP production. Significant genotype-dependent changes in the proteome were observed for HR RPE at baseline (cytoskeleton, MAPK signaling) and after CSE exposure, where a less robust upregulation of the antioxidants and significant downregulation in proteins involved in nucleic acid metabolism and membrane trafficking were noted compared to LR cells.

Additionally, the results also show that the melatonin-treated retinal microglia in the laser-induced mice exhibited enhanced expression of M1-type markers, such as iNOS, CCL-3, CCL-5, and TNF-\u03b1, as well as decreased production of M2-type markers, such as Arg-1, Fizz-1, IL-10, YM-1, and CD206, indicating that melatonin switched the macrophage/microglia polarization from pro-angiogenic M2 phenotype to anti-angiogenic M1 phenotype. Furthermore, the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway was activated during CNV formation, yet was suppressed after an intraperitoneal injection of melatonin. In conclusion, melatonin attenuated CNV, reduced vascular leakage, and inhibited vascular proliferation by switching the macrophage/microglia polarization from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype via inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in CNV.

Mononuclear phagocytes, such as macrophages and microglia cells, can produce VEGF.

To investigate the role of macrophages and CCR2 in AMD, we studied intracellular VEGF content in a laser-induced murine model of choroidal neovascularisation. To this end, we established a technique to quantify the VEGF content in cell subsets from the laser-treated retina and choroid separately. 3 days after laser, macrophage numbers and their VEGF content were substantially elevated in the choroid. Macrophage accumulation was CCR2-dependent, indicating recruitment from the circulation. In the retina, microglia cells were the main VEGF+ phagocyte type. A greater proportion of microglia cells contained VEGF after laser, and this was CCR2-independent. On day 6, VEGF-expressing macrophage numbers had already declined, whereas numbers of VEGF+ microglia cells remained increased.

When we analyzed flatmounts of laser-treated eyes, CCR2-deficient mice showed reduced neovascular areas after 2 weeks, but this difference was not evident 3 weeks after laser. In summary, CCR2-dependent influx of macrophages causes a transient VEGF increase in the choroid.

Here, we used a well-established laser burn (LB)-induced experimental CNV mouse model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of CNV after ocular injury. We analyzed vessel density by lectin labeling. We isolated macrophages, endothelial cells and other cell types by flow cytometry, and analyzed levels of different angiogenic factors in these populations. We used antisera against VEGF-A (aVEGF) and/or antisera against placental growth factor (PLGF; aPLGF) to antagonize CNV. We used an antibody-driven toxin to selectively eliminate macrophages to evaluate the role of macrophages in CNV. We also examined expression of PLGF in macrophage subtypes. The choroidal vessel density increased significantly 7 days after LB. LB increased significantly the levels of VEGF-A and PLGF in mouse eyes. Treatment with aVEGF significantly blunted increases in vessel density by LB. Treatment with aPLGF alone did not significantly reduce increases in vessel density. However, aPLGF significantly increased the inhibitory effects of aVEGF on vessel density increases. While VEGF-A was produced by endothelial cells, macrophages and other types at similar levels, PLGF seemed to be predominantly produced by macrophages. Selective macrophage depletion significantly reduced CNV. M2, but M1 macrophages produced high levels of PLGF.

We have combined laser-induced CNV in mice and bone marrow transplantation with GFP-labeled bone marrow to determine the relative role of recruited blood-derived macrophages versus resident microglia in the retina associated with CNV. Using these chimeric mice, we have found that many GFP-labeled cells infiltrated the retina underlying CNV but not the retina unaffected by CNV. Immunostaining for the cell adhesion molecules VCAM 1, ICAM 1, and PECAM was strongly upregulated in retinal blood vessels under CNV. All GFP-labeled cells were immunoreactive for the macrophage marker F4/80. Most (70%) of the F4/80 immunoreactive cells were GFP-labeled under CNV. The density of resident microglia did not increase. Most GFP-labeled cells were found in close proximity to activated Muller cells. Depleting circulating macrophages with clodronic acid diminished the density of F4/80 immunoreactive cells as well as the density of pERK immunoreactive Muller cells in the retina under CNV. Thus, recruitment of blood-derived macrophages more than resident microglia seems to be associated with CNV.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "choroidal neovascularization"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "34520774", "title": "COL10A1 is a novel factor in the development of choroidal neovascularization.", "abstract": "With the dramatic rise in the aging population, researching age-related macular degeneration (AMD), especially the severe form neovascular AMD (nAMD), has become more important than ever.

One possibility that is a pre-eminent drive is a specific and early conditioning and activation of the myeloid cell infiltrate. Using a laser-induced CNV murine model, we have identified that disruption of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane resulted in an early recruitment of macrophages derived from monocytes and microglia, prior to angiogenesis and contemporaneous with lesional complement activation. Early recruited CD11b(+) cells expressed a definitive gene signature of selective inflammatory mediators particularly a pronounced Arg-1 expression. Accumulating macrophages from retina and peripheral blood were activated at the site of injury, displaying enhanced VEGF expression, and notably prior to exaggerated VEGF expression from RPE, or earliest stages of angiogenesis. All of these initial events, including distinct VEGF (+) Arg-1(+) myeloid cells, subsided when CNV was established and at the time RPE-VEGF expression was maximal. Depletion of inflammatory CCR2-positive monocytes confirmed origin of infiltrating monocyte Arg-1 expression, as following depletion Arg-1 signal was lost and CNV suppressed. Furthermore, our in vitro data supported a myeloid cell uptake of damaged RPE or its derivatives as a mechanism generating VEGF (+) Arg-1(+) phenotype in vivo.

Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles of aged AhR(-/-) and wild-type (wt) mice, using high-throughput RNA sequencing, revealed differential modulation of genes belonging to several AMD-related pathogenic pathways, including inflammation, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix regulation. To investigate AhR regulation of these pathways in wet AMD, we experimentally induced choroidal neovascular lesions in AhR(-/-) mice and found that they measured significantly larger in area and volume compared to age-matched wt mice.

APJ expression in CNV lesions was examined by immunohistochemistry. The sizes of the CNV lesions in the three mouse models were measured and compared histologically using isolectin B4 staining. Macrophage recruitment was measured by flow cytometric analysis. Proliferation of endothelial cells was determined using the alamar Blue assay. Laser photocoagulation significantly increased expression of apelin and APJ in the retina-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) complex. APJ immunoreactive cells were found in the CNV lesions and colocalized with platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, an endothelial cell marker. The sizes of the CNV lesions in apelin-KO or APJ-KO mice decreased significantly compared with those in the WT mice. Macrophages in the RPE complex of the apelin-KO mice, in which gene expression of the inflammatory factors was almost equal to that in WT mice, were recruited as a result of laser photocoagulation to the same degree as in WT mice. In addition, apelin small and interfering RNA (siRNA) suppressed proliferation of endothelial cells independently of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 signaling, while VEGF increased expression of apelin and APJ in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.

This study investigated the role of TNF-\u03b1 receptor 1b in the recruitment of circulating inflammatory cells and the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Methods. Lethally irradiated Tnfrsf1b(-/-) mice and their wild-type (WT) controls were transplanted with whole adult bone marrow (BM) cells, competent for both TNF-\u03b1 receptors 1a and 1b (gfp(+) labeled), as well as with BM cells deficient for TNF-\u03b1 receptor 1b. One month after transplantation CNV was induced by laser damage of Bruch's membrane. Pathologic angiogenesis was estimated qualitatively and quantitatively by histology on choroidal flatmounts and paraffin cross sections. Macrophage invasion was investigated by immunochemistry. Results. One month after transplantation the reconstitution rate measured by FACS analysis was >80% in gfp(+)-chimeric mice. Two weeks after laser injury reduced gfp(+)-cell invasion to the laser scars and decreased pathologic angiogenesis were observed in Tnfrsf1b(-/-) versus WT recipients. Approximately 70% of the invaded gfp(+) cells were labeled with macrophage marker F4/80. Transplantation of TNF-\u03b1 receptor 1b-deficient BM cells in WT recipients reduced the CNV lesion compared with WT and Tnfrsf1b(-/-) recipients that received TNF-\u03b1 receptor-competent BM cells. Transplantation of receptor 1b-deficient cells to Tnfrsf1b(-/-) recipients further reduced the degree of CNV formation. Conclusions.

Key factors were further investigated by immunohistochemistry as well as by intravitreal inhibition experiments and multiplex protein assays in the laser-induced CNV mouse model. Transcriptional profiles of CNV membranes were characterized by enhanced activation of blood vessel development, cytoskeletal organization, and cytokine production, with angiogenesis and wound healing processes predominating in humans and activation of immune processes in mice. Besides several species-specific factors, 95 phylogenetically conserved CNV-associated genes were detected, among which fibroblast growth factor inducible-14 (FN14), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, was identified as a key player of CNV formation. Blocking the pathway by intravitreal injection of a FN14 decoy receptor modulated the cytokine profile - most notably IL-6 - and led to a significant reduction of CNV size in vivo.

The imbalance of lipid production, usage, and transport in local tissues, particularly in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), is increasingly recognized as crucial in AMD development. However, the molecular mechanisms governing lipid metabolism in the RPE remain elusive. LIPIN1, a multifunctional protein acting as both a modulator of transcription factors and a phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP1), is known to play important regulatory roles in lipid metabolism and related biological functions, such as inflammatory responses. While deficits in LIPIN1 have been linked to multiple diseases, its specific roles in the retina and RPE remain unclear. In this study, we investigated LIPIN1 in RPE integrity and function using a tissue-specific knockout animal model. The clinical and histological examinations revealed age-dependent degeneration in the RPE and the retina, along with impaired lipid metabolism. Bulk RNA sequencing indicated a disturbance in lipid metabolic pathways. Moreover, these animals exhibited inflammatory markers reminiscent of human AMD features, including deposition of IgG and C3d on Bruch's membrane. Collectively, our findings indicate that LIPIN1 is a critical component of the complex regulatory network of lipid homeostasis in the RPE.

Additionally, frequent intravitreal injections can prove a burden for patients and caregivers. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has been explored as an additional therapeutic target, due to the involvement of Ang-2 in DME and nAMD pathogenesis. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that targeting both VEGF and Ang-2 may improve clinical outcomes in DME and nAMD compared with targeting VEGF alone by enhancing vascular stability, resulting in reduced macular leakage, prevention of neovascularization, and diminished inflammation.\u00a0Faricimab, a novel bispecific antibody that targets VEGF-A and Ang-2, has been evaluated in clinical trials for DME (YOSEMITE/RHINE) and nAMD (TENAYA/LUCERNE). These trials evaluated faricimab against the anti-VEGFA/B and anti-placental growth factor fusion protein aflibercept, both administered by intravitreal injection. In addition to faricimab efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics, durability was evaluated during the trials using a treat-and-extend regimen. At 1\u00a0year, faricimab demonstrated non-inferior vision gains versus aflibercept across YOSEMITE/RHINE and TENAYA/LUCERNE. In YOSEMITE/RHINE, faricimab improved anatomic parameters versus aflibercept. Reduction of central subfield thickness (CST), and absence of both DME and intraretinal fluid were greater in faricimab- versus aflibercept-treated eyes. In TENAYA/LUCERNE, CST reductions were greater for faricimab than aflibercept at the end of the head-to-head phase (0-12\u00a0weeks), and were comparable with aflibercept at year 1, but with less frequent dosing. CST and vision gains were maintained during year 2 of both YOSEMITE/RHINE and TENAYA/LUCERNE. These findings suggest that dual Ang-2/VEGF-A pathway inhibition may result in greater disease control versus anti-VEGF alone, potentially addressing the unmet needs and reducing treatment burden, and improving real-world outcomes and compliance in retinal vascular diseases. Long-term extension studies (RHONE-X, AVONELLE-X) are ongoing.

Nevertheless, complete resolution of retinal fluid accumulation is often stated to be a key goal of therapy for nAMD, even though some eyes may never achieve a fluid-free macula despite regular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment.

In this context, we highlight the importance of correctly identifying retinal fluid types in nAMD and avoiding confusion with other optical coherence tomography signs that may respond differently to therapy, such as subretinal pseudocysts. Current evidence shows that IRF is associated with poor outcomes and an increased risk of developing atrophy and fibrosis; resolution of this retinal fluid type should remain a treatment target. However, the literature around SRF indicates that low levels of this fluid type, potentially up to 150-200\u00a0\u00b5m in thickness, may be tolerated with minimal impact on vision, and that SRF could be protective against the development and progression of macular atrophy and fibrosis.

Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies pose one opportunity to rebalance demand and capacity in macular services. However, there is a lack of evidence to guide early-adopters seeking to use AI as a solution to demand-capacity imbalance. This study aims to provide guidance for these early adopters on how AI-enabled macular services may best be implemented by exploring what will influence the outcome of AI implementation and why. Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants. Data were analysed with the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to identify factors likely to influence implementation outcomes. These factors and the primary data then underwent a secondary analysis using the Fit between Individuals, Technology and Task (FITT) framework to propose an actionable intervention. nAMD treatment should be initiated at face-to-face appointments with clinicians who recommend year-long periods of AI-enabled scheduling of treatments. This aims to maintain or enhance the quality of patient communication, whilst reducing consultation frequency. Appropriately trained photographers should take on the additional roles of inputting retinal imaging into the AI device and overseeing its communication to clinical colleagues, while ophthalmologists assume clinical oversight and consultation roles. Interoperability to facilitate this intervention would best be served by imaging equipment that can send images to the cloud securely for analysis by AI tools. Picture Archiving and Communication Software (PACS) should have the capability to output directly into electronic medical records (EMR) familiar to clinical and administrative staff.

To explore the performance of a DLS for multiple retinal lesion screening using UWF fundus images from patients in rural areas. In this diagnostic study, a previously developed DLS based on UWF fundus images was used to screen for 5 retinal lesions (retinal exudates or drusen, glaucomatous optic neuropathy, retinal hemorrhage, lattice degeneration or retinal breaks, and retinal detachment) in 24 villages of Yangxi County, China, between November 17, 2020, and March 30, 2021.

At baseline, eyes receiving supplemental treatment were significantly more likely to have thicker retinas (mean CST, 370.5\u03bcm vs. 304.4\u03bcm; P\u00a0= 0.0001), subretinal fluid (54.8% vs. 21.2%; P < 0.0001), and larger pigment epithelial detachment height (215.7 \u03bcm vs. 175.9 \u03bcm; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). These features have previously been associated with difficult-to-treat nAMD. Although BCVA and CST generally remained constant throughout the trial in eyes without supplemental treatment, the small number of eyes receiving supplemental treatment on average lost 1 line of vision from baseline to week 96 (mean,\u00a0-5.7 ETDRS score letters) and CST continued to increase over time. Absolute BCVA at week 96 was similar irrespective of supplemental treatment status (71.1 and 73.7 letters). Best-corrected visual acuity and CST generally improved within 28 days of supplemental treatment. Although the PDS Q24W effectively maintains vision and retinal stability in most eyes with nAMD, a small proportion of patients with features of difficult-to-treat nAMD may benefit from supplemental intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and initial close monitoring is recommended.

Neovascular AMD (nAMD) is an advanced stage of AMD treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGFs).

This study assesses the health-economic impact of anti-VEGF agents with lower injection frequency that have the potential to reduce treatment burden and compares it to the standard of care. We developed a cost-minimization model to evaluate the direct medical costs associated with first-line unilateral anti-VEGF treatment across a 3-year time horizon in the Netherlands. The analysis compared aflibercept 8\u00a0mg, aflibercept 2\u00a0mg, bevacizumab, faricimab, and ranibizumab. Our model adopted a treat-and-extend (T&E) regimen for aflibercept 2\u00a0mg, bevacizumab, and ranibizumab. For aflibercept 8\u00a0mg, a flexible regimen that was extendable up to 24\u00a0weeks was applied, while faricimab followed a flexible regimen that was extendable up to 16\u00a0weeks. Additionally, since list prices may vary from net prices, we calculated the break-even price for each anti-VEGF in comparison to bevacizumab, which is the recommended first-line treatment due to its low medication price. Based on list prices, aflibercept 8\u00a0mg led to the lowest treatment costs (\u20ac16,251 per patient over a 3-year time horizon), closely followed by bevacizumab (\u20ac17,616 per patient over a 3-year time horizon). Ranibizumab led to the highest per-patient costs (\u20ac31,746 over a 3-year time horizon). For bevacizumab, most costs were attributable to administration, while for the other anti-VEGFs, most were attributable to medication. Aflibercept 8\u00a0mg is cost-saving compared to bevacizumab at their medication prices at the time of writing. Aflibercept 2\u00a0mg, faricimab, and ranibizumab should be priced below \u20ac488, \u20ac591, and \u20ac75, respectively. To be cost-equal to bevacizumab with current list prices, anti-VEGFs should be administered with a maximum of 12.7 to 13.8 injections over a 3-year time horizon. According to the injection frequency observed in clinical trials, aflibercept 8\u00a0mg would be the anti-VEGF that generates the lowest per-patient healthcare costs for the treatment of nAMD in the Netherlands after a treatment period of three years.

Studies and clinical experiments have shown that the oral Chinese medicine Xueshuantong combined with anti-VEGF therapy is more effective, and this study aims to explore the molecular mechanism. The TCMSP database was used to identify the main Xueshuantong components. The PubChem database and SWISS Target Prediction data were used to find the SMILES molecular formulas of compounds and corresponding target genes and disease-related genes were searched using the GEO, DisGeNET, and GeneCards databases. Venny was used to identify the intersecting wet AMD-related genes and Xueshuantong targets and Cytoscape software was used to construct direct links between the drug components and disease targets. Then, PPI networks were constructed using the STRING website. R software was used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. Cytoscape software was used for topological analyses, and AutoDock Vina v.1.1.2 software was used for molecular docking. 64 compounds corresponding to four drugs were found by the TCMSP database, 1001 total drug targets were found by the PubChem database, 607 wet AMD target genes were found by the GEO, DisGeNET, and GeneCards databases, and 87 Xueshuantong target genes for wet AMD were obtained. Then, by constructing the drug component and disease target network and PPI network, we found that the components closely interacted with VEGF, TNF, caspase 3, CXCL8, and AKT1, which suggested that the therapeutic effects might be related to the inhibition of neovascularization, inflammation, and AKT pathway. Then, GO enrichment analysis showed that the biological processes response to hypoxia, positive regulation of angiogenesis, and inflammatory response were enriched. KEGG enrichment results showed that the HIF-1 and pi3k-akt pathways may mediate the inhibition of wet AMD by Xueshuantong. Topological analysis results identified 10 key proteins, including VEGF, TNF, AKT1, and TLR4. The results of molecular docking also confirmed their strong binding to their respective compounds. In this study, it was confirmed that Xueshuantong could inhibit wet AMD by targeting VEGF, TNF, TLR4, and AKT1, multichannel HIF-1, and the PI3K-AKT pathway, which further proved the therapeutic effects of Xueshuantong combined with single anti-VEGF therapy on wet AMD and provided new insights into the study of novel molecular drug targets for the treatment of wet AMD.", "tags": ["anti-VEGF", "wet AMD"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["Xueshuantong"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "39504678", "title": "Ranibizumab treatment improves the reading speed of patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration: A nonrandomized clinical trial using the Radner reading chart.", "abstract": "Intravitreal injections with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs can slow progression in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).

In the central retinal vein occlusion group, there was an increase in the mean visual acuity compared to the baseline value at every visit in the absence of serous macular detachment, whereas the mean visual acuity decreased compared to the baseline value at every visit except at the 3-month visit in the presence of serous macular detachment. The ellipsoid zone defect was more prominent in the presence of serous macular detachment in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion, whereas there was no significant difference in the ellipsoid zone in the absence or presence of serous macular detachment in eyes with central retinal vein occlusion. In the group with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion, the initial mean visual acuity increase observed in the first year was maintained in cases without serous macular detachment but not in those with serous macular detachment.

This open-label, dose-escalation nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted from February 2023 to May 2024 at 2 study sites in China. Patients with genetically confirmed biallelic disease-linked CYP4V2 variants received subretinal injections of rAAV2-hCYP4V2 at 1 of 2 dosage levels and were followed up for 12 months.

The primary outcome was safety, assessed by clinical examination of ocular inflammation and evaluated by routine clinical chemistry and immunogenicity testing. Secondary outcomes were changes in visual function from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), microperimetry, and contrast sensitivity 12 months after treatment. Among 12 patients with BCD (6 patients per dose group), mean (SD) patient age was 40.5 (7.1) years, and 5 patients (42%) were female. No severe adverse events related to the treatment were observed. However, mild intraocular inflammation was noted in 1 participant. The median (IQR) baseline BCVA letter score for the study eye was 34 (10-53), equivalent to 20/200 Snellen, while the nonstudy eye had a median (IQR) BCVA of 60 (40-67), equivalent to approximately 20/63 Snellen.

This open-label, exploratory nonrandomized clinical trial identified no serious safety concerns related to gene therapy over 12 months' follow-up among patients with BCD. While improvement in BCVA was noted, the magnitude was within test-retest values typically noted in eyes with very low levels of visual acuity, and BCVA improvement in both the study and nonstudy eyes could be related to a learning effect, with greater improvement in the study eye possibly related to study eyes' being the worse-seeing eye.

Here, we reported that JNK activation by atRAL drove photoreceptor ferroptosis through ferritinophagy. In photoreceptor cells loaded with atRAL, activated JNK phosphorylated c-Jun, which facilitated its nuclear translocation and promoted the expression of the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4). Elevated NCOA4 induced ferritin degradation via lysosomal processing, a process known as ferritinophagy, thereby releasing a large amount of labile iron. Iron overload led to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation, ultimately culminating in ferroptosis.

Furthermore, we noted a reduction in the Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins, which are crucial for forming and maintaining photoreceptor outer segments that are PUFA-enriched ciliary structures. Diminution in Bardet-Biedl syndrome-proteins content combined with our electron microscopic observations raises the possibility that AdipoR1 deficiency might impair ciliary function. Treatment with inhibitors of ceramide synthesis led to substantial elevation of \u03c93 LC-PUFAs, alleviating photoreceptor degeneration and improving retinal function. These results serve as the proof of concept for a ceramide-targeted strategy to treat retinopathies linked to PUFA deficiency, including age-related macular degeneration.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["inhibitors of ceramide synthesis"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "39355864", "title": "prominin-1-null Xenopus laevis develop subretinal drusenoid-like deposits, cone-rod dystrophy and RPE atrophy.", "abstract": "Prominin-1 (PROM1) variants are associated with inherited, non-syndromic vision loss.

STC-1 is a secreted calcium/phosphorus regulatory protein that exerts diverse protective effects. Accumulating evidence suggests that STC-1 protects retinal cells from ischemic injury, oxidative stress, and excessive apoptosis through enhancing the expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2). Furthermore, STC-1 exerts its antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting the activation of microglia and macrophages, as well as the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6.

Galectin-1/ Lgals1 was upregulated by CNV induction, whereas deletion of Lgals1 suppressed CNV together with downstream molecules of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)2. Loss of Lgals1 also attenuated subretinal fibrosis, expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers including Snai1, and phosphorylation of SMAD family member 2. Supporting these in vivo findings, silencing of LGALS1 in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells inhibited TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT-related molecules and cell motilities. Conversely, overexpression of Lgals1 enhanced CNV and subretinal fibrosis. Specimens from patients with AMD demonstrated colocalization of galectin-1 with VEGFR2 in neovascular endothelial cells and with phosphorylated SMAD2 in RPE cells.

This relationship is compromised in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by the dysfunction or death of the choroidal vasculature. This chapter will provide a basic description of the human Bruch's membrane and choroidal anatomy and physiology and how they change in AMD.The choriocapillaris is the lobular, fenestrated capillary system of choroid. It lies immediately posterior to the pentalaminar Bruch's membrane (BrMb). The blood supply for this system is the intermediate blood vessels of Sattler's layer and the large blood vessels in Haller's layer.In geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry AMD, large confluent drusen form on BrMb, and hyperpigmentation (presumably dysfunction in RPE) appears to be the initial insult. The resorption of these drusen and loss of RPE (hypopigmentation) can be predictive for progression of GA. The death and dysfunction of CC and photoreceptors appear to be secondary events to loss in RPE. The loss of choroidal vasculature may be the initial insult in neovascular AMD (nAMD). We have observed a loss of CC with an intact RPE monolayer in nAMD, by making RPE hypoxic. These hypoxic cells then produce angiogenic substances like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulate growth of new vessels from CC, resulting in choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Reduction in blood supply to the CC, often stenosis of intermediate and large blood vessels, is associated with CC loss.The polymorphisms in the complement system components are associated with AMD. In addition, the environment of the CC, basement membrane and intercapillary septa, is a proinflammatory milieu with accumulation of proinflammatory molecules like CRP and complement components during AMD. In this toxic milieu, CC die or become dysfunctional even early in AMD. The loss of CC might be a stimulus for drusen formation since the disposal system for retinal debris and exocytosed material from RPE would be limited. Ultimately, the photoreceptors die of lack of nutrients, leakage of serum components from the neovascularization, and scar formation.Therefore, the mutualistic symbiotic relationship of the photoreceptor/RPE/BrMb/CC complex is lost in both forms of AMD.

Subretinal HpODE induced retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and retinal degeneration resulting in loss of RPE cells, photoreceptors and retinal thinning. RPE degeneration and atrophy were detected by day 5, followed by neural tissue degeneration at day 12 with robust TUNEL positive cells. Western blot analysis confirmed an increase in pro-apoptotic Bak protein at day 12 in retinal tissues. Oxidative damage biomarkers (4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and nitrotyrosine) increased in retinal tissue from days 5-12. M\u00fcller glial activation was observed in the HpODE injected area at day 5 followed by its remodeling and migration in the outer retina by day 20. RT-qPCR analysis further indicated upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) both in retinal and RPE/choroidal tissue as early as day 2 and persisted until day 12. Upregulation of oxidative stress markers such as NADPH oxidase (NOX and DOUX family) was detected early in retinal tissue by day 2 followed by its upregulation in choroidal tissue at day 5. Neovascularization was demonstrated from day 12 to day 20 post HpODE injection in choroidal tissue. The results from this study indicate that subretinal HpODE induces advanced AMD phenotypes comprising many aspects of both dry/early and late) and neovascular/late AMD as observed in humans. Within 3 weeks via oxidative damage, upregulation of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory genes, pro-apoptotic Bak and pro-angiogenic VEGF upregulation occurs leading to CNV formation. This experimental model of subretinal HpODE is an appropriate model for the study of AMD and provides an important platform for translational and basic research in developing new therapies particularly for early/dry AMD where currently no viable therapies are available.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "dry AMD"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["HpODE"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "26839315", "title": "Angiopoietin-like Protein 2 Is a Multistep Regulator of Inflammatory Neovascularization in a Murine Model of Age-related Macular Degeneration.", "abstract": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a pathogenic process of age-related macular degeneration, a vision-threatening disease. The retinal pigment epithelium and macrophages both influence CNV development. However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we focus on Angptl2 (angiopoietin-like protein 2), a cytokine involved in age-related systemic diseases. Angptl2 was originally identified as an adipocytokine and is also expressed in the eye. Using a laser-induced CNV model, we found thatAngptl2KO mice exhibited suppressed CNV development with reduced macrophage recruitment and inflammatory mediator induction. The mediators monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin-1\u03b2 (Il-1\u03b2),Il-6, matrix metalloprotease-9 (Mmp-9), and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (Tgf-\u03b21) that were up-regulated during CNV development were all suppressed in the retinal pigment epithelium-choroid of CNV models generated in theAngptl2KO mice. Bone marrow transplantation using wild-type and KO mice suggested that both bone marrow-derived and host-derived Angptl2 were responsible for macrophage recruitment and CNV development. Peritoneal macrophages derived fromAngptl2KO mice expressed lower levels of the inflammatory mediators. In the wild-type peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, Angptl2 induced the mediators via integrins \u03b14 and \u03b22, followed by the downstream activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK. The activation of NF-\u03baB and ERK by Angptl2 also promoted macrophage migration. Therefore, Angptl2 from focal tissue might trigger macrophage recruitment, and that from recruited macrophages might promote expression of inflammatory mediators including Angptl2 in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion to facilitate CNV development. Angptl2 might therefore represent a multistep regulator of CNV pathogenesis and serve as a new therapeutic target for age-related macular degeneration.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "choroidal neovascularization"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "23094067", "title": "Hyperglycaemia exacerbates choroidal neovascularisation in mice via the oxidative stress-induced activation of STAT3 signalling in RPE cells.", "abstract": "Choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) that occurs as a result of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) causes severe vision loss among elderly patients. The relationship between diabetes and CNV remains controversial. However, oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of both AMD and diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the influence of diabetes on experimentally induced CNV and on the underlying molecular mechanisms of CNV. CNV was induced via photocoagulation in the ocular fundi of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. The effect of diabetes on the severity of CNV was measured. An immunofluorescence technique was used to determine the levels of oxidative DNA damage by anti-8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) antibody, the protein expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in mice with CNV. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that had been cultured under high glucose was quantitated using the 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) method. p-STAT3 expression was examined using Western blot analysis. RT-PCR and ELISA processes were used to detect VEGF expression. Hyperglycaemia exacerbated the development of CNV in mice. Oxidative stress levels and the expression of p-STAT3 and VEGF were highly elevated both in mice and in cultured RPE cells.

The JAK-2/STAT3 pathway inhibitor AG490 blocked VEGF expression but had no effect on the production of ROS in vitro. These results suggest that hyperglycaemia promotes the development of CNV by inducing oxidative stress, which in turn activates STAT3 signalling in RPE cells.

Extensive evidence has shown that FAK is activated in angiogenic response. This study aims to investigate the effect of FAK on CNV formation. The Brown-Norway (BN) rats underwent laser rupture of Bruch's membrane to induce CNV and were then killed at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days following laser injury.

Expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RPE cells were investigated by RT-PCR and Western blot. Two kinds of coculture models were used to observe the effects of specific blockade of FAK in RPE cells on the proliferation and migration of choroidal microvascular endothelial cells (CECs), respectively. FAK was highly expressed in the rat RPE-choroid tissue after photocoagulation. In vitro experiment showed that FAK was involved in hypoxia signaling in cultured RPE cells. The absence of FAK effectively reduced the expression of hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha and VEGF in RPE cells, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and migration of CECs. Our results suggest that FAK pathway activation plays a role in the development of CNV, and regulates the proliferation and migration of CECs by acting through HIF-1 and then up-regulating the expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF in RPE cells.

This model, inclusive of ECs, CFs, and RPE cells, exhibited similarities with in vivo choroidal vessels, as confirmed through immunohistochemistry of extracellular matrix markers and vascular-related markers, as well as choroid angiogenesis sprouting assay analysis.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that active Rap1 binding to IQGAP1 is necessary and sufficient to reduce Rac1 activation in CECs, and CNV. We found that pharmacologic activation of Rap1 or adenoviral transduction of constitutively active Rap1a reduced VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation, migration, and tube formation in CECs. Following pharmacologic activation of Rap1, VEGF-mediated Rac1 activation was reduced in CECs transfected with an IQGAP1 construct that increased active Rap1-IQGAP1 binding but not in CECs transfected with an IQGAP1 construct lacking the Rap1 binding domain. Specific knockout of IQGAP1 in endothelial cells reduced laser-induced CNV and Rac1 activation in CNV lesions, but pharmacologic activation of Rap1 did not further reduce CNV compared to littermate controls.

The underlying mechanism of how drusen might elicit CNV remains undefined. Cigarette smoking, oxidative damage to the RPE and inflammation are postulated to be involved in the pathophysiology of the disease. To better understand the cellular mechanism(s) linking oxidative stress and inflammation to AMD, we examined the expression of pro-inflammatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-angiogenic pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF) in RPE from smoker patients with AMD.

MCP-1, VEGF and PEDF expression was examined by real-time PCR, Western blot, and ELISA. Low levels of MCP-1 protein were detected in RPE from AMD smoker patients relative to controls. Both MCP-1 mRNA and protein were downregulated in ARPE-19 cells and RPE/choroids from C57BL/6 mice after 5 days and 3 weeks of exposure to HQ-induced oxidative injury.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that, beyond supplying nutrients to the outer retina, the different choroidal cells contribute to the retina's homeostasis, especially by paracrine signaling. However, the precise role of each cell type is currently unclear. Here, we developed a choroidal substitute using the self-assembly approach of tissue engineering. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, as well as choroidal stromal fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and melanocytes, were isolated from human eye bank donor eyes. Fibroblasts were cultured in a medium containing serum and ascorbic acid. After six weeks, cells formed sheets of extracellular matrix (ECM), which were stacked to produce a tissue-engineered choroidal stroma (TECS). These stromal substitutes were then characterized and compared to the native choroid. Their ECM composition (collagens and proteoglycans) and biomechanical properties (ultimate tensile strength, strain and elasticity) were similar. Furthermore, RPE cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and choroidal melanocytes successfully repopulated the stromas. Physiological structures were established, such as a confluent monolayer of RPE cells, vascular-like structures and a pigmentation of the stroma. Our TECS thus recaptured the biophysical environment of the native choroid, and can serve as study models to understand the normal interactions between the RPE and choroidal cells, as well as their reciprocal exchanges with the ECM. This will consequently pave the way to derive accurate insight in the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases affecting the choroid. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The choroid is traditionally known for supplying blood to the avascular outer retina. There has been a renewed attention directed towards the choroid partly due to its implication in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries. Since AMD involves the dysfunction of the choroid/retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) complex, a three-dimensional (3D) model of RPE comprising the choroid layer is warranted. We used human choroidal cells to engineer a choroidal substitute. Our approach takes advantage of the ability of cells to recreate their own environment, without exogenous materials.

However, VEGF signaling is only one component of the complex, multifactorial pathophysiology of retinal diseases, and many patients have residual disease activity despite ongoing anti-VEGF treatment. The angiopoietin/tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Ang/Tie2) signaling pathway is critical to endothelial cell homeostasis, survival, integrity, and vascular stability. Ang-2 can interfere with Ang-1/Tie2 signaling and is increased in several retinal diseases. Lack of Tie2 signaling due to elevated Ang-2 levels drives vascular instability through pericyte dropout, neovascularization, vascular leakage, inflammation, and fibrosis. Although Ang-2 and VEGF can synergistically promote vascular instability and neovascularization, Ang-2 may also mediate vascular instability independently of VEGF. Faricimab is a bispecific antibody designed for intraocular use that inhibits two distinct pathways via Ang-2 and VEGF-A blockade. Clinical biomarkers of vascular instability are important for evaluating disease control and subsequent treatment decisions. These biomarkers include measurement/evaluation with optical coherence tomography (OCT) of intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, central subfield thickness, and pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs), and fluorescein angiography imaging of macular leakage and PEDs. Hyperreflective foci (HRF), thought to be representative of activated microglia, indicating an inflammatory microenvironment, and epiretinal membranes (ERMs), a marker for retinal fibrotic proliferation in diabetic macular edema (DME), are both also identified using OCT. Here we summarize data (secondary endpoint and prespecified exploratory analyses as well as post hoc analyses) from six Phase III trials suggest that dual therapy Ang-2/VEGF-A inhibition with faricimab (6\u00a0mg) has a greater effect on reducing/resolving biomarkers of vascular instability than aflibercept (2\u00a0mg), by both controlling neovascularization and vascular leakage (with resultant resolution of exudation associated with DME, neovascular age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion), as well as by targeting inflammation (reduction of HRF in DME) and retinal fibrotic proliferation (reducing the risk of ERMs in eyes with DME).

However, since it does not standardize unstructured data, such as medical imaging, using this data in multi-institutional collaborative research becomes challenging. To overcome this limitation, extensions such as the Radiology Common Data Model (R-CDM) have emerged to include and standardize these data types. This work aims to demonstrate that by standardizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) data into an R-CDM format, multi-institutional collaborative studies analyzing changes in retinal thickness in patients with long-standing chronic diseases can be performed efficiently. We standardized OCT images collected from two tertiary hospitals for research purposes using the R-CDM. As a proof of concept, we conducted a comparative analysis of retinal thickness between patients who have chronic diseases and those who have not. Patients diagnosed or treated for retinal and choroidal diseases, which could affect retinal thickness, were excluded from the analysis. Using the existing OMOP-CDM at each institution, we extracted cohorts of patients with chronic diseases and control groups, performing large-scale 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM). Subsequently, we linked the OMOP-CDM and R-CDM to extract the OCT image data of these cohorts and analyzed central macular thickness (CMT) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness using a linear mixed model. OCT data of 261,874 images from Ajou University Medical Center (AUMC) and 475,626 images from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) were standardized in the R-CDM format.

Traditional methods for diagnosing retinal disorders often rely heavily on manual interpretation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, which can be time-consuming and dependent on the expertise of ophthalmologists. This leads to challenges in early diagnosis, especially as retinal diseases like diabetic macular edema (DME), Drusen, and Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) become more prevalent. OCT helps ophthalmologists diagnose patients more accurately by allowing for early detection. This paper offers a hybrid SE (Squeeze-and-Excitation)-Enhanced Hybrid Model for detecting retinal disorders from OCT images, including DME, Drusen, and CNV, using artificial intelligence and deep learning. The model integrates SE blocks with EfficientNetB0 and Xception architectures, which provide high success in image classification tasks. EfficientNetB0 achieves high accuracy with fewer parameters through model scaling strategies, while Xception offers powerful feature extraction using deep separable convolutions. The combination of these architectures enhances both the efficiency and classification performance of the model, enabling more accurate detection of retinal disorders from OCT images. Additionally, SE blocks increase the representational ability of the network by adaptively recalibrating per-channel feature responses. The combined features from EfficientNetB0 and Xception are processed via fully connected layers and categorized using the Softmax algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage architecture called Choroidal Layer Analysis network (CLA), that may be considered the first attempt in this research community for joint segmentation of choroidal sublayers and choroidal vessels in OCT images. CLA employs the encoder-decoder network with the residual U-shape module as the backbone.

For more accurate segmentation of large choroidal vessels with ambiguous contours and imbalanced spatial distribution, the second stage introduces an active contour-based loss to refine the contours of choroidal vessels simultaneously with precise identification of each vessel via contextual modeling. To train, test and validate the proposed model, we conducted a choroidal segmentation dataset containing 800 OCT images, with their sublayers and large choroidal vessels manually annotated. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared with other state-of-the-art segmentation networks in large margins.

With advancements in computer vision technology, several automated models have been proposed to improve diagnostic accuracy for retinal diseases and medical imaging in general.

This framework is designed to achieve high accuracy in identifying various retinal diseases while overcoming inherent challenges associated with fundus images.

Prediction of progression to GA within 13 months was evaluated with area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUROC) as well as area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. The study included a total of 417 patients: 316 in data set 1 (mean [SD] age, 74 [8]; 185 [59%] female), 53 in data set 2, (mean [SD] age, 83 [8]; 32 [60%] female), and 48 in data set 3 (mean [SD] age, 81 [8]; 32 [67%] female). The AUROC for prediction of progression from iAMD to GA within 1 year was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.95; AUPRC, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.85-0.95]; sensitivity, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]; specificity, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.87-0.92]) for data set 1. The addition of expert-annotated SD-OCT features to the model resulted in no improvement compared to the fully autonomous model (AUROC, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92-0.95; P\u2009=\u2009.19). On an independent validation data set (data set 2), the model predicted progression to GA with an AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.96; AUPRC, 0.92 [0.89-0.94]; sensitivity, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.74-0.98]; specificity, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.63-0.91]). At a high-specificity operating point, simulated clinical trial recruitment was enriched for patients progressing to GA within 1 year by 8.3- to 20.7-fold (data sets 2 and 3). The fully automated, position-aware deep-learning algorithm assessed in this study successfully predicted progression from iAMD to GA over a clinically meaningful time frame. The ability to predict imminent GA progression could facilitate clinical trials aimed at preventing the condition and could guide clinical decision-making regarding screening frequency or treatment initiation.", "tags": ["macular", "age-related macular degeneration", "geographic atrophy"], "paper_type": "Clinical Trial", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "39349754", "title": "Differences in structural optical coherence tomography and infrared enface images between non-exudative macular neovascularizations secondary to AMD and pachychoroid disease.", "abstract": "To provide an analysis of structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and enface infrared reflectance (IR) differences between non-exudative macular neovascularizations (NE MNVs) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and NE MNVs secondary to pachychoroid spectrum.

A total of 41 samples of AMD and 50 normal samples were obtained from the data set GSE29801 for differential gene expression analysis and functional enrichment.

Repopulation of choroidal vasculature early in the disease process may halt disease progression. Prior studies have shown that injection of donor cells in suspension results in significant cellular efflux and poor cell survival. As such, the goal of this study was to develop a hydrogel system designed to support choroidal endothelial cell transplantation. A library of hydrogels was synthesized using laminin (i.e., LN111, LN121, and LN421), carboxy methyl chitosan, and oxidized dextran via reversible Schiff base chemistry. Each of the developed self-healing hydrogels was readily injectable into the suprachoroidal space, with ideal gelation, mechanical, and degradation properties. While all hydrogels were found to be compatible with choroidal endothelial cell survival in vitro, only LN111 and LN121 gels were well-tolerated in vivo. To determine if hydrogel mediated cell delivery enhances donor cell retention and survival in vivo, iPSC-derived choroidal endothelial cell laden hydrogels were injected into the suprachoroidal space of an immunocompromised choroidal cell injury rat model. Significantly more donor cells were retained and survived in eyes that received cell laden hydrogels versus contralateral hydrogel free controls. Furthermore, donor cells positive for human nuclear antigen were identified in the choroid of hydrogel eyes only.

The alternative pathway (AP) of complement has been linked to the pathogenesis of AMD. In particular, rare variants (RVs) in the complement factor I (CFI) gene encoding the Factor I (FI) protein confer increased AMD risk. The prevalence of CFI RVs are well characterised in European AMD, however little is known about other populations. The Finnish population underwent genetic restriction events which have skewed allele frequencies in unexpected ways. A series of novel or enriched CFI RVs were identified in individuals with dry AMD from the Finnish Biobank Cooperative (FINBB), but the relationship between these genotypes and contribution to disease was unclear. Understanding how RVs impact the ability of FI to regulate the complement system is important to inform mechanistic understanding for how different genotypes contribute to disease development. To explore this a series of in vitro assays were used to functionally characterise the protein products of 3 CFI RVs enriched in FINBB dry AMD, where no prior data were available. The G547R variant resulted in almost complete loss of both classical pathway and AP regulatory potential. The c.982 g>a variant encoding G328R FI perturbed an exon splice enhancer site which resulted in exon skipping and a premature stop codon in vitro and low levels of FI in vivo. Despite detailed analysis no defect in levels or function was demonstrated in T107A.

This study aimed to evaluate the patient-centered economic burden of exudative AMD for 2 years, including nonreimbursement and out-of-pocket costs, compared with nonexudative AMD using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the OMOP CDM, which included 2,006,478 patients who visited Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from June 2003 to July 2019. We defined the exudative AMD group as patients aged >50 years with a diagnosis of exudative AMD and a prescription for anti-VEGFs or verteporfin. The control group was defined as patients aged >50 years without a diagnosis of exudative AMD or a prescription for anti-VEGFs or verteporfin. To adjust for selection bias, controls were matched by propensity scores using regularized logistic regression with a Laplace prior. We measured any medical cost occurring in the hospital as the economic burden of exudative AMD during a 2-year follow-up period using 4 categories: total medical cost, reimbursement cost, nonreimbursement cost, and out-of-pocket cost. To estimate the average cost by adjusting the confounding variable and overcoming the positive skewness of costs, we used an exponential conditional model with a generalized linear model. We identified 931 patients with exudative AMD and matched 783 (84.1%) with 2918 patients with nonexudative AMD. In the exponential conditional model, the total medical, reimbursement, nonreimbursement, and out-of-pocket incremental costs were estimated at US $3426, US $3130, US $366, and US $561, respectively, in the first year and US $1829, US $1461, US $373, and US $507, respectively, in the second year.

Twenty-nine treatment-naive eyes (29 patients, 10 men and 19 women, mean age 76.28 \u00b1 10.86 years) were included. A mean of 5.3 \u00b1 3.5 injections was administered during 12 months. At Month 12 visit, patients showed an improved best-corrected visual acuity (P = 0.01), a reduction of linear dimension of the entire lesion on fluorescein angiography (P = 0.02), and a reduction of the entire lesion width on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (P < 0.001). At baseline, in all cases we distinguished on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scan a highly reflective subretinal lesion, above and separate from the retinal pigment epithelium. The highly reflective subretinal lesion showed a significant reduction of width along the length of a single B-scan, at Month 12 follow-up visit (P < 0.001). It is notable that a small \"discreet\" pigment epithelial detachment associated with the highly reflective subretinal lesions was present in 28 of 29 eyes at baseline and after treatment (at Month 12 follow-up visit). A discreet pigment epithelial detachment represents a common associated finding of classic choroidal neovascularization.

Arguably the most widely utilised model replicating AMD is laser generated CNV by rupture of Bruch's membrane in rodents. Heretofore CNV evaluation via in-vivo imaging techniques has been hamstrung by a lack of appropriate rodent fundus camera and a non-standardised analysis method. The aim of this study was to establish a simple, quantifiable method of fluorescein fundus angiogram (FFA) image analysis for CNV lesions. Laser was applied to 32 Brown Norway Rats; FFA images were taken using a rodent specific fundus camera (Micron III, Phoenix Laboratories) over 3 weeks and compared to conventional ex-vivo CNV assessment. FFA images acquired with fluorescein administered by intraperitoneal injection and intravenous injection were compared and shown to greatly influence lesion properties. Utilising commonly used software packages, FFA images were assessed for CNV and chorioretinal burns lesion area by manually outlining the maximum border of each lesion and normalising against the optic nerve head. Net fluorescence above background and derived value of area corrected lesion intensity were calculated. CNV lesions of rats treated with anti-VEGF antibody were significantly smaller in normalised lesion area (p < 0.001) and fluorescent intensity (p < 0.001) than the PBS treated control two weeks post laser. The calculated area corrected lesion intensity was significantly smaller (p < 0.001) in anti-VEGF treated animals at 2 and 3 weeks post laser. The results obtained using FFA correlated with, and were confirmed by conventional lesion area measurements from isolectin stained choroidal flatmounts, where lesions of anti-VEGF treated rats were significantly smaller at 2 weeks (p = 0.049) and 3 weeks (p < 0.001) post laser.

The most important effects of TA consist in the stabilisation of the blood-retinal barrier and the down-regulation of inflammation. TA also has anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrotic properties. The peculiar characteristic of being well tolerated by ocular tissues and the capability to remain active for many months after a single intravitreal injection, make this drug a safe and effective alternative. In the past decade, intravitreal injection of TA (IVTA) has emerged as a useful treatment of several ocular diseases such as uveitis, macular edema secondary to retinal vasculature disease, neovascularisation and vitreoretinopathy. In this paper, we review all the available evidence of its use in AMD as mono-therapy or in combination with other treatments, and we discuss which role TA will play in the treatment of AMD in the future. The first experiences with IVTA as monotherapy for the treatment of exudative AMD reported a positive outcome in transiently reducing the leakage from CNV. However, in the long-term follow-up, IVTA as monotherapy had no effect on the risk of severe visual acuity loss, despite a significant anti-angiogenic effect found 3 months after the treatment. Consequently, studies using the combination of IVTA and photodynamic therapy (PDT), which acts synergistically, were performed. They reported to improve vision and to reduce the number of re-treatments with PDT. A large number of publications confirmed the positive synergic role of combining TA and PDT (therapies) for the treatment of all types of CNV: classic or predominantly classic, occult or minimally classic and RAP (Retinal Angiomatous Proliferation) lesions. The advantages registered with the use of IVTA plus PDT compared to PDT alone were partially limited by the side effects, such as the rapid evolution of cataract. Nevertheless, cataract surgery may stimulate the development of CNV (result in stimulating CNV). However, in large, randomized, clinical trials on combination therapy of TA and PDT, visual acuity failed to show an improvement, even though the lesion size and subretinal fluid had decreased, compared to controls treated with PDT alone. Some authors reported an increased risk of developing macular atrophy after the combination therapy with IVTA and PDT. Reduction of the PDT fluence rate in association with the use of steroids resulted in reducing the risk of macular atrophy and in a better visual acuity outcome. The introduction of anti-VEGF-based drugs has revolutionized the treatment of AMD and has replaced all the previous therapies used for CNV. Visual improvement becomes an expectation in a higher proportion of patients, previously limited to minimizing vision loss. Anti-VEGF therapy also resulted in superior visual improvement compared to all types of combination therapy with IVT and PDT. Nevertheless, anti-VEGF monotherapy also has many limitations due to the need of repetitive treatments, increased costs and tachyphylaxis. Treatment regimens involving TA in combination therapy with anti-VEGF and PDT may preserve benefits for substantially longer periods. A question remains open on whether a combination treatment with anti-VEGF, triamcinolone and/or PDT may be a treatment option in patients with exudative AMD, by offering, with one cycle of therapy, functional VA benefits comparable to those observed with continued monthly anti-VEGF therapy.

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, and reference lists. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata12.0 software, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), retinal thickness, and lesion size were evaluated. Twelve randomized controlled trials spanning from 2010 to 2014 and involving 5,225 patients were included. A significant difference was observed between the intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) group and the intravitreal bevacizumab group (standard mean difference = -0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.23 to -0.05). No significant differences were observed in best corrected VA, retinal thickness, or lesion size between IVR and the intravitreal aflibercept group. Compared to monthly injection, IVR as-needed injections (PRN) can raise VA by 1.97 letters (weighted mean difference = 1.97, 95% CI = 0.14-3.794). Combination therapy of IVR and photodynamic therapy can significantly raise VA by 2.74 letters when combined with IVR monotherapy (weighted mean difference = 2.74, 95% CI = 0.26-5.21). The superiority remains unclear between IVR and intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of neovascular AMD. Intravitreal aflibercept dosed every 2 months required fewer injection times, but produced similar efficacy as monthly IVR. IVR PRN could significantly increase VA. Combined with photodynamic therapy, IVR therapy could also increase VA effectively.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "wet AMD"], "paper_type": "Review or Commentary", "drug_names": ["ranibizumab", "bevacizumab", "aflibercept"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "24206851", "title": "Implementation studies of ranibizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.", "abstract": "The pathogenesis of AMD is associated with age changes plus pathological changes involving oxidative stress and an altered inflammatory response leading to injury of retinal pigment epithelial cells and the adjacent choroidea and photoreceptor cells. AMD is divided into early, intermediate and advanced AMD. The advanced form of AMD is further divided into non-neovascular AMD and neovascular AMD. The diagnosis of neovascular AMD is based on FA and clinical characteristics of the eyes. The CNV lesions are by their growth pattern divided into type 1 CNV lesions, which grow primarily beneath the RPE, and type 2 CNV lesions, which have penetrated the RPE and evolve within the subretinal space. The natural course of neovascular AMD leads to visual disability in a majority of cases within the first years after onset, primarily caused by the development of subfoveal fibrous tissue and atrophy of the RPE. The prognosis of visual acuity in neovascular AMD has been markedly improved by the introduction of an intravitreal administered VEGF inhibitor (ranibizumab) given on a monthly basis. Treatment with ranibizumab for neovascular AMD was introduced in Denmark in 2006 under a fully reimbursed national healthcare plan. Treatment with ranibizumab is given in a variable dosing regimen that varies from the monthly dosing regimen administered in the studies that led to the approval of ranibizumab for neovascular AMD in Europe. The main objectives of this PhD thesis were to evaluate and potentially improve treatment with ranibizumab in a variable OCT guided regimen for neovascular AMD. Another intension of this PhD thesis was to prepare the conditions for future research to further improve the visual prognosis in neovascular AMD treated with anti-VEGF agents. The first study revealed that vision was improved in eyes with active neovascular AMD treated for 1 year in a variable ranibizumab treatment regimen as compared to PDT and the natural course of the disease. We assumed by comparing our results with other pro re nata regimens based on a monthly reassessment of disease activity that our patients could gain substantial vision if we optimized our frequency of re-examinations. The analysis demonstrated that we could discontinue treatment in patients who had a poor visual acuity during the first 3 months of treatment and that visual outcome could be improved by minimizing the delay from diagnosis of neovascular AMD to first administered ranibizumab injection. This study led to changes in departmental treatment procedures. In the second study, we found that type 2 CNV lesions had a higher hazard ratio as compared to type 1 CNV lesions in developing subfoveal fibrosis. Prominent subfoveal fibrous tissue and fibrous tissue with retinal atrophy led to poorer visual performances in eyes with neovascular AMD after 2 years of treatment as compared with eyes without subfoveal fibrous tissue. In the development of randomized clinical trials designed to address how treatment with VEGF inhibitors can be improved by limiting the growth of subfoveal fibrous tissue or neuroretinal atrophy, it is important to define subgroups of eyes at risk of these pathological changes. The second PhD study has contributed to identify this subgroup of eyes. The third study included in this PhD thesis revealed that the annual incidence rate of AMD-related legally blind persons registered in Denmark has halved during the last decade, with the bulk of the reduction observed after the introduction of ranibizumab for neovascular AMD.", "tags": ["retina", "retinal", "anti-VEGF"], "paper_type": "Other", "drug_names": ["ranibizumab"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "37571296", "title": "Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate, an Active Green Tea Component to Support Anti-VEGFA Therapy in Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration.", "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a largely incurable disease and an emerging problem in aging societies.

Abnormal growth of choroidal blood vessels, or choroidal neovascularization (CNV), is a hallmark of the neovascular (wet) form of advanced AMD and leads to significant vision loss. A growing body of evidence supports a strong link between neovascular disease and inflammation. Metabolites of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from the cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase pathway serve as vital second messengers that regulate a number of hormones and growth factors involved in inflammation and vascular function. Using transgenic mice with altered CYP lipid biosynthetic pathways in a mouse model of laser-induced CNV, we characterized the role of these lipid metabolites in regulating neovascular disease. We discovered that the CYP-derived lipid metabolites epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs) and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) are vital in dampening CNV severity. Specifically, overexpression of the monooxygenase CYP2C8 or genetic ablation or inhibition of the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) enzyme led to increased levels of EDP and EEQ with attenuated CNV development. In contrast, when we promoted the degradation of these CYP-derived metabolites by transgenic overexpression of sEH, the protective effect against CNV was lost. We found that these molecules work in part through their ability to regulate the expression of key leukocyte adhesion molecules, on both leukocytes and endothelial cells, thereby mediating leukocyte recruitment.

These nanoparticles, with PLGA as a carrier, can slowly release encapsulated Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) and target the choroidal neovascularization marker CD105 to enhance drug accumulation, increases vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression between vascular endothelial cells, effectively reduce neovascularization leakage and inhibit Angiopoietin 2(Ang 2) secretion by endothelial cells.

Fresh venous blood was obtained and stained with monoclonal antibodies and analyzed using flow cytometry within 6 hours of phlebotomy. The percentage of CD11b+ monocytes, granulocytes, and CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocytes positive for CD200 or CD200R in patients and controls, respectively. Patients with neovascular AMD had a higher percentage of CD11b+CD200+ monocytes and CD200+ monocytes compared with controls. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the intergroup differences observed were independent of age. Moreover, an age-related increment in CD200 expression on monocytes was observed in controls with healthy eyes, but not in patients with neovascular AMD. We did not find any differences in CD200 and CD200R expression between patients with subretinal fibrosis and patients without subretinal fibrosis. The surface expression of CD200 on circulating CD11b+ monocytes was found to be increased in patients with neovascular AMD compared with controls with healthy eyes. This novel finding supports the notion that altered regulation of the inflammatory response plays an integral role in the pathogenesis of AMD.

In particular, the rd8 mutation of the Crb1 gene present in the C57BL/6N has been shown to impact certain ocular phenotypes and appears to augment phenotypes generally associated with inflammation.

Yet laser-induced CNV was comparable in size between the two substrains. This lack of difference in CNV size was correlated with a gene expression profile that was comparable between the two substrains, due to the fact that the degree of change in gene expression of inflammatory markers after CNV was blunted in 6N mice.

Here, we applied metabolomics to human sera of patients with nAMD during an active (exudative) phase of the pathology and found higher lactate levels and a shift in the lipoprotein profile (increased VLDL-LDL/HDL ratio). Similar metabolomics changes were detected in the sera of mice subjected to laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In this experimental model, we provide evidence for two sites of lactate production: first, a local one in the injured eye, and second a systemic site associated with the recruitment of bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells. Mechanistically, lactate promotes the angiogenic response and M2-like macrophage accumulation in the eyes. The therapeutic potential of our findings is demonstrated by the pharmacological control of lactate levels through pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibition by dichloroacetic acid (DCA). Mice treated with DCA exhibited normalized lactate levels and lipoprotein profiles, and inhibited CNV formation. Collectively, our findings implicate the key role of the PDK/lactate axis in AMD pathogenesis and reveal that the regulation of PDK activity has potential therapeutic value in this ocular disease. The results indicate that the lipoprotein profile is a traceable pattern that is worth considering for patient follow-up. KEY MESSAGES: Lactate and lipoprotein profile are associated with the active phase of AMD and CNV development. Lactate is a relevant and functional metabolite correlated with AMD progression.

The expression of vasohibin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, and pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Vasohibin-1 was detected not only in CD31-positive endothelial cells but also in CD68-positive macrophages and \u03b1SMA-positive retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Antiangiogenic therapies have greatly improved clinical outcomes in the last decade; however, vision improves in less than half of patients treated for neovascular AMD, and treatments remain inadequate for atrophic AMD. Many studies focus on genetic predisposition or the association of outcomes in trials of human neovascular AMD but are unable to evaluate the effects between different cell types involved in AMD and the signaling events that take place to cause pathologic biologic events. This manuscript complements other reviews in that it describes what is known generally in human AMD studies and clinical trials testing methods to inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF inhibitors) and presents pathologic signaling events that develop in two important cell types, the RPE cells and the CECs, when stimulated by stresses or placed into conditions similar to what is currently understood to occur in neovascular AMD. This manuscript complements other reviews by discussing signaling events that are activated by cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions. These considerations are particularly important when considering growth factors, such as VEGF, which are important in physiologic and pathologic processes, or GTPases that are present but active only if GTP bound. In either case, it is essential to understand the role of signaling activation to distinguish what is pathologic from what is physiologic. Particularly important is the essential role of activated Rac1 in CEC transmigration of the RPE monolayer, an important step in blindness associated with neovascular AMD. Other concepts discussed include the importance of feed-forward loops that overwhelm mechanisms that seek to restore homeostasis in cells and the importance of regulating, instead of abolishing, signaling events in a chronic, complex disease, such as neovascular AMD. These concepts are important as we move to the next stages in developing treatments for neovascular AMD. A novel therapeutic strategy that will be discussed is activating an isoform of the GTPase, Rap1, which can regulate downstream signaling and a pathologic feed-forward loop leading to Rac1 activation and migration of CECs.", "tags": ["macular", "age-related macular degeneration", "choroidal neovascularization"], "paper_type": "Review or Commentary", "drug_names": ["vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF inhibitors)"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "31021381", "title": "Imaging, Genetic, and Demographic Factors Associated With Conversion to Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.", "abstract": "Risk factors associated with the development of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been identified.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a vital role in the formation of neovascular AMD. VEGF regulates angiogenesis, enhances vascular permeability, and drives the formation of choroidal neovascularization. As a result of the introduction of anti-VEGF drugs, the incidence of blindness from neovascular AMD has greatly reduced. Anti-VEGF drugs are used as a first-line treatment for neovascular AMD. The most recent anti-VEGF drug is conbercept, also named KH902, which was approved for the treatment of neovascular AMD by the China Food and Drug Administration in December 2013. In this review, recent clinical information regarding the use of conbercept to treat neovascular AMD is summarized. Conbercept is a soluble receptor decoy that blocks all isoforms of VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and PlGF, which has a high binding affinity to VEGF and a long half-life in vitreous. Preclinical studies have demonstrated its anti-angiogenesis activity in both ocular neovascular disease models and tumor models. Clinical trials of conbercept have shown its superior efficacy and safety. Patients respond well even with 3-month treatment intervals following loading doses once a month for 3 months. The potential therapeutic effect of conbercept on the treatment of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, a special type of neovascular AMD, is also promising. In summary, conbercept is a new treatment option for ophthalmologists and their patients and may help address the limitations of current anti-VEGF drugs.", "tags": ["macular", "age-related macular degeneration", "anti-VEGF", "choroidal neovascularization"], "paper_type": "Review or Commentary", "drug_names": ["conbercept", "KH902"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "36899935", "title": "Melatonin Inhibits VEGF-Induced Endothelial Progenitor Cell Angiogenesis in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.", "abstract": "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is described as abnormal angiogenesis in the retina and the leaking of fluid and blood that generates a huge, dark, blind spot in the center of the visual field, causing severe vision loss in over 90% of patients.

Ocular tissues were obtained from eight aged control donors (age range, 75-86 years; mean age, 79.8 years) with no evidence or history of chorioretinal disease and from 12 donors diagnosed with AMD (age range, 61-105 years; mean age, 83.9 years).

Choroidal blood vessels were identified with mouse anti-human CD-34 antibody in adjacent tissue sections. Three independent observers graded the immunohistochemical reaction product. The most prominent sites of VEGF and PEDF localization in aged control choroid were RPE-Bruch's membrane-choriocapillaris complex including RPE basal lamina, intercapillary septa, and choroidal stroma. There was no significant difference in immunostaining intensity and localization of VEGF and PEDF in aged control choroids. The most intense VEGF immunoreactivity was observed in leukocytes within blood vessels. AMD choroid had a similar pattern and intensity of VEGF immunostaining to that observed in aged controls. However, PEDF immunoreactivity was significantly lower in RPE cells (p=0.0073), RPE basal lamina (p=0.0141), Bruch's membrane (p<0.0001), and choroidal stroma (p=0.0161) of AMD choroids.

We used standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration for screening, data abstraction, and study assessment. Two review authors independently screened records, abstracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies; we resolved discrepancies by discussion or with the help of a third review author when needed.

At two years, the mean change in BCVA from baseline was 7.2 ETDRS letters for aflibercept groups versus 7.9 for ranibizumab groups. Sufficient data were not available for calculation of confidence intervals.The proportion of participants who gained 15 or more letters of BCVA by one year of follow-up was approximately 32% for both aflibercept and ranibizumab (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.11; high-quality evidence), and by two years of follow-up was approximately 31% (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12; high-quality evidence). Similar small proportions of participants in the aflibercept and ranibizumab groups lost 15 or more letters of BCVA at one year (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30; high-quality evidence); this outcome was not reported for two-year follow-up. Data were not reported on the proportion of participants with BCVA worse than 20/200 at one- or two-year follow-up.Participants treated with aflibercept or ranibizumab showed similar improvement in morphological outcomes, as assessed from images (central retinal thickness and CNV size). At one year, the proportion of eyes that achieved dry retina was similar between aflibercept and ranibizumab groups (absence of cystic intraretinal fluid and subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT); RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; high-quality evidence). In addition, investigators reported no difference in reduction of CNV area between aflibercept- and ranibizumab-treated eyes at one year (MD -0.24 mm(2), 95% CI -0.78 to 0.29; high-quality evidence). Data were not reported for the proportion of eyes with absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography at one- or two-year follow-up.Overall, occurrence of serious systemic adverse events was similar and comparable in aflibercept- and ranibizumab-treated groups at one year (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.25). Risk of any serious ocular adverse event was lower in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group, but the risk estimate is imprecise (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.07).

Furthermore, we histologically analyzed surgically removed choroidal neovascular membranes secondary to underlying diseases other than AMD to discern whether the cellular and extracellular components of the membranes of eyes with AMD are similar to those with diseases other than AMD.

Surgically excised subfoveal membranes were processed and evaluated by light and transmission electron microscopy. There were no statistically significant differences observed between eyes with neovascular and non-neovascular AMD. The single most important difference between eyes with and without AMD was the amount of basal laminar deposit (P < 0.001). Eyes with AMD displayed fewer large choroidal vessels in the submacular choroid than eyes without AMD (mean density values of all choroidal vessels [arteries and veins] were 3.5 +/- 1.5 mm(-1) and 5.7 +/- 1.6 mm(-1), P < 0.001, respectively).

Eyes with AMD displayed significantly more soft, diffuse, and large drusen, as well as basal laminar deposit, in the macular area than controls. Combining our data with data from the literature, we conclude that AMD can be interpreted as a dynamic process with early proliferation and subsequent atrophy of capillaries of the choriocapillaris.

High levels of MAC result in cell lysis and RPE degeneration is a hallmark of advanced AMD.

A novel in\u2009vivo ligand binding assay independently confirmed a marked increase in Scg3 binding to CNV vessels, whereas VEGF showed no increase in CNV-selective binding. A new technique of functional immunohistochemistry allowed the visualization and confirmed the increase in in\u2009vivo Scg3 binding to CNV vasculatures, including CNV microcapillaries with detailed vascular structures, which was blocked by anti-Scg3 humanized antibody Fab fragment (hFab). The hFab effectively alleviated laser-induced CNV with an efficacy similar to the anti-VEGF drug aflibercept. Homozygous deletion of the Scg3 gene in mice significantly reduced the severity of CNV.

Time-varying analysis showed that faster subfoveal choroidal thickness reduction and IC-FD% (6-mm) increase were associated with geographic atrophy onset (P < 0.05), whereas IC-FD% (3-mm) increase was associated with wet AMD (P = 0.03). Notably, greater IC-FD% increases in the 3 mm (area under the curve = 0.72) and 6 mm (area under the curve = 0.89) were better predictive of wet AMD and geographic atrophy development, respectively. Our longitudinal IC-FD% assessment emphasizes the role of progressive choriocapillaris changes as a biomarker for AMD progression.

Two female patients, with foveal-involving GA secondary to AMD, were assessed. All eyes demonstrated concurrent features indicative of ARCA on multimodal imaging including a paucity of choroidal vasculature, reduced choroidal pigmentation, macular pigmentary changes, peripapillary atrophy, and subretinal drusenoid deposits. Clinically, progression of GA with coalescence of lobular lesions was observed. Notably, UWF FAF with green-(California) and blue excitation wavelengths (California and EIDON) revealed atypical patterns characterized by isofluorescent FAF signals (indistinguishable from surrounding tissue) or hyperautofluorescent GA lesions. In these cases, blue excitation wavelengths were more effective than green light for delineating GA, owing to increased contrast from hypoautofluorescence related to macular pigment surrounding the lesion. In patients with GA and concomitant ARCA, atypical FAF patterns on UWF imaging complicate the accurate delineation and monitoring of GA. Atypical FAF patterns appear due to the properties of the confocal apertures and postprocessing features of UWF imaging that allow for the detection of scleral autofluorescence in patients with reduced choroidal vasculature, pigment and thickness.

We designed a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector comprising the human AIPL1 coding sequence driven by a human rhodopsin kinase promoter region (rAAV8.hRKp.AIPL1). The product was manufactured under a Specials Licence from the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Authority (UK) and made available to affected children with local ethics approval. We administered the product to one eye of each child by subretinal injection. The children were prescribed oral prednisolone to protect against harm from inflammation. Outcome measures included visual acuity (as assessed with a novel touchscreen test), functional vision (assessed by observing and recording the children's visual behaviour and their ability to perform simple vision-guided tasks), visual evoked potentials (assessed by recording cortical electrophysiological responses to full-screen black-and-white flickering stimuli), and retinal structure (assessed with handheld optical coherence tomography [OCT] and widefield fundus imaging). To identify adverse effects, including inflammation and retinal detachment, we conducted ocular examinations using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and dilated fundoscopy. Safety was further assessed by testing of visual acuity, ophthalmoscopy, handheld OCT and widefield fundus imaging. Patients were selected for treatment between July 12, 2019, and March 16, 2020. Before intervention, the children's binocular visual acuities were limited to perception of light. At a mean of 3\u00b75 years (range 3\u00b70-4\u00b71) after intervention, the visual acuities of the children's treated eyes had improved to a mean of 0\u00b79 logarithm of the minimal angle of the minimum angle of resolution ([logMAR] range 0\u00b78-1\u00b70); visual acuities before intervention were equivalent to 2\u00b77 logMAR. In contrast, the visual acuities of the children's untreated eyes became unmeasurable at the final follow-up. In the two children able to comply with testing, an objective test of visual acuity confirmed improvements in visual function, and measurement of visual evoked potentials showed enhanced activity of the visual cortex, specific to the treated eyes. In three of the children, structural lamination of the outer retina was better preserved in the treated eye than in the untreated eye, and, for all four children, retinal thickness appeared better preserved in the treated eye than in the untreated eye. The treated eye of one child developed cystoid macular oedema. No other safety concerns were identified.

In the proposed GKE-TUNet model, a skeleton extraction network is pre-trained to extract the anatomical topology of retinal vessels from refined segmentation labels. During vessel segmentation, the dense skeleton graph is sampled as a graph of key-points and connections and is incorporated into the skip connection layer of TransUNet. The graph vertices are used as node features and correspond to positions in the low-level feature maps. The graph attention network (GAT) is used as the graph convolution backbone network to capture the shape semantics of vessels and the interaction of key locations along the topological direction. Finally, the node features obtained by graph convolution are read out as a sparse feature map based on their corresponding spatial coordinates.

The use of modern, deep learning-based segmentation methods has been inhibited by a lack of large datasets with detailed annotations of the blood vessels. To address this issue, recent work has employed transfer learning, where a segmentation network is trained on synthetic OCTA images and is then applied to real data.

Blue-light fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) were utilized to monitor GA progression and the onset of foveal involvement. The study analyzed VA changes over an average follow-up of 60 \u00b1 26.4 months, encompassing 785 observations. Mixed-effects models with natural splines assessed the effects of demographic and ocular characteristics on baseline VA and its rate of decline. Survival analyses compared the timing of anatomic changes with the most rapid functional declines, indicated by the highest first derivative of VA trajectories. Discrepancies between visual and anatomic changes were explored using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Monthly VA changes, onset and impact of foveal involvement, and factors influencing baseline VA and rate of decline. Visual acuity declined consistently by an average of 0.010 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) per month (standard error [SE], 0.0003; P < 0.001). The onset of foveal involvement significantly exacerbated this decline, adding an average loss of 0.15 LogMAR (SE, 0.02; P < 0.001). Stabilization of VA typically occurred around 41 months post-foveal involvement. Significant factors associated with worse baseline VA were older age, female gender, unifocal GA morphology, and drusen-associated forms of GA (P < 0.05). The most rapid declines in VA typically occurred about 9 months (interquartile range, 0-27 months) before detectable subfoveal changes.

This study demonstrates that significant VA loss in GA can precede detectable foveal involvement, suggesting a window for early interventions to slow the progression of visual impairment.

Seven OCT-defined features of atrophy were manually annotated: hypertransmission, RPE attenuation/disruption, complete RPE loss, ellipsoid zone disruption, external limiting membrane (ELM) disruption, subsidence of the outer plexiform layer and inner nuclear layer, and/or hyporeflective wedge-shaped band, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness. Association between OCT-defined features of atrophy and presence of a deep visual sensitivity defect at a local, pointwise level. All OCT-defined features of atrophy were individually associated with the presence of a deep visual sensitivity defect at a pointwise level in univariable mixed-effects logistic regression analyses (P < 0.001 for all). However, only hypertransmission, complete RPE loss, ELM disruption, and ONL thickness remained significantly and independently associated with deep visual sensitivity defects in a multivariable analysis (P \u2264 0.011). A prediction model incorporating these 4 OCT features (partial area under the curve [pAUC] at \u226590% specificity\u00a0= 0.80) outperformed models using any single feature alone in predicting the presence of deep visual sensitivity defects (pAUC\u00a0= 0.65 to 0.78, respectively; P \u2265 0.040).

However, genetic predisposition or age-related degeneration can lead to retinal damage that severely impairs vision or causes blindness. Treatment options for retinal diseases are limited, and there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Cell and gene therapies are promising because of the efficacy of delivery systems that transport therapeutic genes to targeted retinal cells. Gene delivery systems hold great promise for treating retinal diseases by enabling the targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to affected cells or by converting endogenous cells into functional ones to facilitate nerve regeneration, potentially restoring vision. This review focuses on two principal categories of gene delivery vectors used in the treatment of retinal diseases: viral and non-viral systems. Viral vectors, including lentiviruses and adeno-associated viruses, exploit the innate ability of viruses to infiltrate cells, which is followed by the introduction of therapeutic genetic material into target cells for gene correction. Lentiviruses can accommodate exogenous genes up to 8 kb in length, but their mechanism of integration into the host genome presents insertion mutation risks. Conversely, adeno-associated viruses are safer, as they exist as episomes in the nucleus, yet their limited packaging capacity constrains their application to a narrower spectrum of diseases, which necessitates the exploration of alternative delivery methods. In parallel, progress has also occurred in the development of novel non-viral delivery systems, particularly those based on liposomal technology. Manipulation of the ratios of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules within liposomes and the development of new lipid formulations have led to the creation of advanced non-viral vectors. These innovative systems include solid lipid nanoparticles, polymer nanoparticles, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles. Compared with their viral counterparts, non-viral delivery systems offer markedly enhanced loading capacities that enable the direct delivery of nucleic acids, mRNA, or protein molecules into cells. This bypasses the need for DNA transcription and processing, which significantly enhances therapeutic efficiency. Nevertheless, the immunogenic potential and accumulation toxicity associated with non-viral particulate systems necessitates continued optimization to reduce adverse effects in vivo . This review explores the various delivery systems for retinal therapies and retinal nerve regeneration, and details the characteristics, advantages, limitations, and clinical applications of each vector type. By systematically outlining these factors, our goal is to guide the selection of the optimal delivery tool for a specific retinal disease, which will enhance treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes while paving the way for more effective and targeted therapeutic interventions.", "tags": ["retina", "retinal"], "paper_type": "Review or Commentary", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "9274771", "title": "Functional recovery of retina after sodium iodate injection in mice.", "abstract": "ERGs and the azide responses were recorded from mice before and periodically up to 6 weeks after retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage by iodate injection to follow the recovery of retinal pigment epithelium and retinal function.

The retinal phenotype of rd12 mice were studied using serial indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, electroretinography (ERG), genetic analysis including linkage studies and gene identification, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical analysis. Mice homozygous for the rd12 mutation showed small punctate white spots on fundus examination at 5 months of age. The retina in the rd12 homozygote had a normal appearance at the light microscopic level until 6 weeks of age when occasional voids appeared in the outer segments (OS) of the photoreceptor (PR) cells. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) appeared normal until 3 months of age though more obvious voids were detected in the OS. By 7 months of age, 6 to 8 layers of ONL remained in the mutant retina, and the OS were obviously shorter. The first sign of retinal degeneration was detected at the electron microscopic level around 3 weeks of age when occasional small lipid-like droplets were detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). By 3 months of age, much larger, lipid-like droplets accumulated in RPE cells accompanied by some OS degeneration. While the histology indicated a relatively slow retinal degeneration in the rd12 homozygous mutant mice, the rod ERG response was profoundly diminished even at 3 weeks of age. Genetic analysis showed that rd12 was an autosomal recessive mutation and mapped to mouse chromosome 3 closely linked to D3Mit19, a location known to be near the mouse Rpe65 gene. Sequence analysis showed that the mouse retinal degeneration is caused by a nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the Rpe65 gene, and the gene symbol for the rd12 mutation has been updated to Rpe65rd12 to reflect this. No RPE65 expression, 11-cis retinal, or rhodopsin could be detected in retinas from rd12 homozygotes, while retinyl esters were found to accumulate in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).

Light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) can serve as a model in which to study the response of the retina to stress. Of note, many genetic mutant mice are in a C57BL/6\u00a0J background and are thus resistant to the usual LIRD models. We recently developed a new model of fundus camera-delivered light-induced retinal degeneration (FCD-LIRD) which is effective in strains of mice expressing the light-resistant variant of RPE65 (450Met), including C57BL/6\u00a0J. In this work we investigated whether FCD-LIRD would be useful as a model in which to test the effect of genetic mutations on the response of the retina to stress. Furthermore, we tested whether oxidative stress plays an important role in the setting of this new FCD-LIRD model. FCD-LIRD was applied to C57BL/6\u00a0J mice and to mice simultaneously deficient in three proteins that are important in the response of the retina to oxidative stress (SOD1, DJ-1 and Parkin). Using fundus photography, we found that retinal damage was dramatically increased in the SOD1/DJ-1/Parkin deficient mice compared to C57BL/6\u00a0J. Outer retinal OCT volume and RPE cell morphology analysis in ZO-1-stained flat mounts added support to these findings. Gene expression analysis confirmed a strong oxidative stress response after FCD-LIRD, which was differentially altered in the SOD1/DJ1/Parkin deficient mice. We conclude that FCD-LIRD is useful to study the effect of genetic mutations on the response of the retina to light stress in light-resistant strains of mice. Furthermore, oxidative stress seems to be an important component of FCD-LIRD. Finally, we have established protocols to quantify the effect of FCD-LIRD on the retina and RPE which will be useful for future studies.

HSP27 suppression also reduced retinal cell apoptosis caused by light exposure. In addition, the loss of retinal function caused by light exposure was reversed on suppressing HSP27 expression. We subsequently found that the expression of the Rho gene and immunofluorescence staining of rhodopsin and arrestin (cell markers for photoreceptors) increased in sHSP27-treated retinas. HSP27 suppression did not affect the survival of ganglion and amacrine cells. Retinal cell apoptosis and functional loss were observed after 7-day light exposure.

In the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells of Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, an animal model of genetic retinal degeneration (RD), miR-24 was found lower and CHI3L1 level was higher in comparison with those in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Other changes in the eyes of RCS rats include activated AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways and abnormal autophagy in the RPE cells. Such roles of miR-24 and CHI3L1 were further confirmed in RCS rats by subretinal injection of agomiR-24, which decreased CHI3L1 level and preserved retinal structure and function. Upstream, NF-\u03baB was identified as the regulator of miR-24 in the RPE cells of these rats. On the other hand, in SD rats, intraocular treatment of antagomiR-24 induced pathological changes similar to those in RCS rats. The results revealed the protective roles for miR-24 to RPE cells and a mechanism for RD in RCS rats was proposed: extracellular stress stimuli first activate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, which lowers miR-24 expression so that CHI3L1 increased. CHI3L1 sequentially results in aberrant autophagy and RPE dysfunction by activating AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways. Taken together, although the possibility, that the therapeutic effects in RCS rats are caused by other transcriptional changes regulated by miR-24, cannot be excluded, these findings indicate that miR-24 protects rat retina by targeting CHI3L1.

Here, we use this model to identify the earliest events after Otx2 ablation. Electroretinography and gene expression analyses suggest a nonautonomous, RPE-dependent origin for photoreceptor degeneration. This is confirmed by RPE-specific ablation of Otx2, which results in similar photoreceptor degeneration. In contrast, constitutive Otx2 expression in RPE cells prevents degeneration of photoreceptors in Otx2-ablated retinas. We use chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massive sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis to identify the molecular network controlled in vivo by Otx2 in RPE cells. We uncover four RPE-specific functions coordinated by Otx2 that underpin the cognate photoreceptor degeneration. Many direct Otx2 target genes are associated with human retinopathies, emphasizing the significance of the model.

However, dark-adaptation did not significantly alter the amount of subretinal fluid observed in stage III rd10 mice. In addition, dark-rearing of rd10 mice from P6 to P30 slowed retinal degeneration. Visual experience in the form of light/dark adaptation exerts a significant effect on outer retinal structure in the context of photoreceptor degeneration.

Moreover, we found that miRNA 133b that was considered specifically to express in midbrain dopaminergic neurons was markedly upregulated in retinal DA-ACs after NaIO(3) administration. The overexpression of mir-133b negatively regulated the expression of pitx3, an important transcription factor, and led to a series of deficits of DA-ACs such as TH and D2 receptor expression and DA producing, which may play a causative role in pathological events of horizontal cells and mRGCs. After mir-133b was interfered with mir-133b/RNAi, not only those deficits were rescued, but also the amplitude of b-wave and summed OPs of ERG were improved significantly. In conclusion, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that intra-retinal neurons can be directly injured by NaIO(3) at early stage, and that mir-133b level effectively controls synaptic contacts or neural interactions among DA-ACs, horizontal cells, and mRGCs.

A number of classes of metabolites were consistently dysregulated during degeneration: vitamin A analogues, fatty acid amides, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, acyl carnitines and several phospholipid species. For the first time, a distinct temporal trend of several important metabolites including DHA (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid), all-trans-retinal and its toxic end-product N-retinyl-N-retinylidene-ethanolamine were observed between healthy and dystrophic retinas. In this study, metabolomics was further used to determine the temporal effects of the therapeutic intervention of grafting stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in dystrophic retinas, which significantly prevented photoreceptor atrophy in our previous studies. The result revealed that lipid levels such as phosphatidylethanolamine in eyes were restored in those animals receiving the RPE grafts. In conclusion, this study provides insight into the metabolomics of retinal degeneration, and further understanding of the efficacy of RPE transplantation.This article is part of the themed issue 'Quantitative mass spectrometry'.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration"], "paper_type": "Other", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "36905808", "title": "Melatonin protects retinal integrity through mediated immune homeostasis in the sodium iodate-induced mouse model of age-related macular degeneration.", "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of visual deficiency in older adults worldwide. Melatonin (MT) can potentially reduce retinal deterioration. However, the mechanism by which MT mediates regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the retina is not yet fully understood. The transcriptome profiles of aged or young human retinal tissues from the GEO database were analyzed for MT-related gene expression. The pathological changes in the retina in the NaIO3-induced mouse model were quantitatively determined by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Retinal whole-mounting immunofluorescence staining was conducted to determine the expression of the Treg-specific marker FOXP3. The phenotypes of M1/M2 macrophages were representing related gene markers in the retina. The GEO database includes biopsies from patients with retinal detachment for ENPTD1, NT5E, and TET2 gene expression. A pyrosequencing assay was performed for NT5E DNA methylation on human primary Tregs, and siTET2 transfection engineering was used. MT synthesis-related genes in retinal tissue may be affected by age. Our study shows that MT can effectively restore NaIO3-induced retinopathy and maintain retinal structural integrity. Importantly, MT may assist the conversion of M1 to M2 macrophages to promote tissue repair, which may be caused by the increased infiltration of Tregs. Moreover, MT treatment may upregulate TET2, and further NT5E demethylation is associated with Treg recruitment in the retinal microenvironment. Our findings suggest that MT can effectively ameliorate retinal degeneration and regulate immune homeostasis via Tregs.

An excessive accumulation of lysosomal-associated lipofuscin waste and an elevated lysosomal pH occur in retinal pigment epithelial cells of the ABCA4-/- mouse model of Stargardt's retinal degeneration. As treatment with the P2Y12 receptor antagonist ticagrelor was previously shown to lower lysosomal pH and lipofuscin-like autofluorescence in these cells, we asked whether oral delivery of ticagrelor also prevented photoreceptor loss. Moderate light exposure was used to accelerate photoreceptor loss in albino ABCA4-/- mice as compared to BALB/c controls. Ticagrelor (0.1%-0.15%) was added to mouse chow for between 1 and 10 months. Photoreceptor function was determined with electroretinograms, while cell survival was determined using optical coherence tomography and histology. Protection by ticagrelor was demonstrated functionally by using the electroretinogram, as ticagrelor-treated ABCA4-/- mice had increased a- and b-waves compared to untreated mice. Mice receiving ticagrelor treatment had a thicker outer nuclear layer, as measured with both optical coherence tomography and histologic sections. Ticagrelor decreased expression of LAMP1, implicating enhanced lysosomal function. No signs of retinal bleeding were observed after prolonged treatment with ticagrelor. Oral treatment with ticagrelor protected photoreceptors in the ABCA4-/- mouse, which is consistent with enhanced lysosomal function.

Omics research has significantly advanced in the last two decades, and metabolomic data of various tissues has finally brought serine metabolism to the forefront of metabolic research, primarily for its varied role throughout the central nervous system. The retina is one of the most complex neuronal tissues with a multitude of functions. Although recent studies have highlighted the importance of free serine and its derivatives to retinal homeostasis, currently few reviews exist that comprehensively analyze the topic. Here, we address this gap by emphasizing how and why the de novo production and demand for serine is exceptionally elevated in the retina. Many basic physiological functions of the retina require serine. Serine-derived sphingolipids and phosphatidylserine for phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neuronal crosstalk of the inner retina via D-serine require proper serine metabolism. Moreover, serine is involved in sphingolipid-ceramide balance for both the outer retina and the RPE and the reductive currency generation for the RPE via serine biosynthesis. Finally and perhaps the most vital part of serine metabolism is free radical scavenging in the entire retina via serine-derived scavengers like glycine and GSH. It is hard to imagine that a single tissue could have such a broad and extensive dependency on serine homeostasis. Any dysregulation in serine mechanisms can result in a wide spectrum of retinopathies. Therefore, most critically, this review provides a strong argument for the exploration of serine-based clinical interventions for retinal pathologies.", "tags": ["retina", "retinal"], "paper_type": "Review or Commentary", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "25103259", "title": "Characterization of a mouse model with complete RPE loss and its use for RPE cell transplantation.", "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major leading cause of visual impairment and blindness with no cure currently established.

Only a fraction of RPE was transduced with the lentivirus; however, the entire RPE monolayer appears healthy, even the RPE cells not expressing the CLC-2-HA.

We investigate the effect of C3 ablation on macrophage activity and phagocytosis by outer retinal macrophages during photo-oxidative damage.

Measurements of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to assess pathology and photoreceptor apoptosis, respectively. Macrophage abundance and phagocytosis were assessed with immunolabeling for pan-macrophage and phagocytic markers, in conjunction with TUNEL staining in cohorts of C3 KO and WT mice. The C3 KO mice exhibited protection against photoreceptor cell death following photo-oxidative damage, which was associated with a reduction in immunoreactivity for the stress-related factor GFAP. In conjunction, there was a reduction in IBA1-positive macrophages in the outer retina compared to the WT mice and a decrease in the number of CD68-positive cells in the outer nuclear layer and the subretinal space.

It is assumed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the presence of iron ions, and this leads to a decrease in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor. It is known that in age-related macular degeneration (AMD), sodium iodate can induce oxidative stress, apoptosis, and retinal damage, which mimic the effects of clinical AMD. Here, the reduction of the a-wave amplitude in mice with sodium iodate-induced age-related macular degeneration is explained. The leading edge of the a-wave is divided into voltages developed by cones and rods. The same oxidative stress model is applied here since sodium iodate causes the creation of ROS in a manner similar to that caused by iron ions, with the exception that the retina is treated as a circuit of various resistances when computing the photoresponse. Moreover, sodium iodate also leads to apoptosis and, hence, may cause misalignment in cones (not in rods) during the initial stage of apoptosis in AMD. To include the effects of apoptosis and shortening in cones and rods, we have used a factor representing the fraction of total cones and rods that are alive. To include the effect of misalignment of cones on the reduction of the a-wave amplitude, we have used the Stiles-Crawford function to calculate the number of photoisomerizations occurring in a photoreceptor misaligned at an angle \u03b8. The results are compared with experimental data. In sodium iodate-treated eyes, the ROS produced can attract calcium ions in the photoreceptor, which increases the calcium influx. In the case of the cones, the inclusion of the misalignment angle in the phototransduction process helps in determining the voltage and slope of the voltage vs. time graph.The smaller the fraction of active photoreceptors, the smaller the amplitude of the a-wave. The calcium influx, misaligned photoreceptors, and total photoreceptor loss all cause the amplitude of the a-wave to decrease, and at any time from the beginning of phototransduction cascade, the calcium influx causes the slope of the a-wave to increase. The reduction in the a-wave amplitude in the eyes of sodium iodate-treated mice is attributed to oxidative stress in both cones and rods and cone misalignment, which ultimately lead to apoptosis and vision loss in AMD.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration"], "paper_type": "Other", "drug_names": ["sodium iodate"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "32744516", "title": "Direct-Coupled Electroretinogram (DC-ERG) for Recording the Light-Evoked Electrical Responses of the Mouse Retinal Pigment Epithelium.", "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a specialized monolayer of cells strategically located between the retina and the choriocapillaris that maintain the overall health and structural integrity of the photoreceptors.

The KO model was examined by genomic Southern blotting, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, funduscopy, LM and EM histopathology, ERG, and TUNEL analyses.

The results indicated a dysfunction in the KO outside the synapses in the distal end of photoreceptors where MRG4 is also localized. Differences in the phenotypes of retinal degeneration in the KO and TG models reflect a dysfunction in the two opposite ends of photoreceptors, i.e., the distal inner/outer segments and proximal synapses, respectively, indicating a second function of MRG4 in the distal photoreceptor and dual functionality of MRG4. Thus, inactivation of MRG4 by gene targeting resulted in a retinal degeneration phenotype quite different from that previously seen in the TG, attesting to the multiplicity of MRG4 function, in addition to the importance of this protein for normal retinal function.

The results were compared to scanning laser ophthalmoscopy of BSP degeneration in human RP. After the loss of all photoreceptor cells in rho-/- mice, the outer retina successively degenerated, leading to approximation and finally a direct contact of inner retinal vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). We could show that it was the event of proximity of retinal vessel and RPE that triggered migration of RPE cells along the contacting vessels towards the inner retina. Ultrastructurally, these mislocalized RPE cells partially sealed the vessels by tight junction linkage and deposited extracellular matrix perivascularly. Also, the vascular endothelium developed fenestrations similar to the RPE-choroid interface. In whole mounts, the pigmented cell clusters outlining retinal capillaries correlated well with BSPs in human RP. The structure of the inner retina remained well preserved, even in late stages. The Rho (-/-) mouse is the first animal model that depicts all major pathological changes, even in the late stages of RP. Using the rho (-/-) mouse model we were able to analyze the complete dynamic process of BSP formation. Therefore we conclude that: (1) In rho (-/-) retinas, BSPs only form in areas devoid of photoreceptors; (2) Direct contact between inner retinal vessels and RPE appears to be a major trigger for migration of RPE cells; (3) The distribution of the RPE cells in BSPs reflects the vascular network at the time of formation.

We used a mouse strain deleted for Sod2 in the RPE to accelerate age-related oxidative stress in the retina and to test the impact of 8-OH-DPAT on the photoreceptor and RPE degeneration developed in these mice.

Photobiomodulation (PBM) using low-energy light in the red-to-near-infrared range is a promising treatment for retinal diseases. This study investigated the effects of multi-wavelength PBM (680, 780, and 830 nm) on sodium iodate-induced oxidatively damaged retinal tissue. In an in vivo rat model of AMD induced by sodium iodate, multi-wavelength PBM effectively protected the retinal layers, reduced retinal apoptosis, and prevented rod bipolar cell depletion. Furthermore, PBM inhibited photoreceptor degeneration and reduced retinal pigment epithelium toxicity. These results suggest that multi-wavelength PBM may be a useful therapeutic strategy for AMD, mitigating oxidative stress, preserving retinal integrity, and preventing apoptosis.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "dry AMD", "wet AMD"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": [], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "33182490", "title": "3D-Reconstructed Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells Provide Insights into the Anatomy of the Outer Retina.", "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is located between the neuroretina and the choroid, and plays a critical role in vision.

Three-dimensional-reconstructed OS revealed the RPE to support large numbers of photoreceptors (90-216 per RPE cell). Larger bi-nucleate RPE maintained more photoreceptors, although their cytoplasmic volume was comparable to smaller mono-nucleate RPE supporting fewer photoreceptors. Scrutiny of RPE microvilli and interdigitating OS revealed the angle and surface area of contact between RPE and photoreceptors. Bi-nucleate RPE contained more mitochondria compared to mono-nucleate RPE. Furthermore, bi-nucleate cells contained larger sub-RPE spaces, supporting a likely association with disease.

Histological analysis using plastic sections showed dosing with BBR preserved photoreceptors. The ERG analysis demonstrated functional protection by BBR in rod-b, -a, and cone-b waves. In OCT images, mice receiving PBS showed severe thinning and disorganization of the photoreceptor layer 7 days after LD, whereas mice treated with BBR had significantly less thinning and disorganization. Consistent with OCT results, the mRNA levels of Rho in the NSR, and Rpe65 and Mct3 in the RPE, were significantly higher in mice treated with BBR.

The main barriers to realizing the benefits of TPE for imaging the human retina arise from concerns about the high light exposure typically needed for informative TPE imaging and the requirement to correlate the ensuing data with different states of health and disease. To overcome these hurdles, we improved TPE efficiency by controlling temporal properties of the excitation light and employed phasor analyses to FLIM and spectral data in mouse models of retinal diseases.

Paraquat was used to create mitochondrial oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was used to stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines in these cells. The production of antioxidant proteins, metallothionein, and inflammatory cytokines was assayed with quantitative real-time PCR. Cell survival was analyzed with microscopy and a cell titer assay. Integrity of the RPE monolayer was determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and with immunocytochemistry with zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) antibody. RPE atrophy was studied in mice deleted for Sod2 (the gene for mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) specifically in the RPE.

To assess the kinetics of the injury/recovery process, the electroretinography (ERG) responses were correlated with ongoing alterations in retinal structure and the global gene expression profile of injured retinas using genome-wide RNA microarray technology, western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses. We observed considerable improvement in the rod cell-mediated ERG response, which was accompanied by the regeneration of RPE within the injury site by the 3rd month post-injury. Our results confirm that the repairing mechanisms within injured retinas involve a significant glial cell reaction marked by glial cell proliferation, migration from their original location toward the injury site, followed by a significant overproduction of NTs such as BDNF, GDNF and NT-3. The global gene expression analysis revealed that initially up-regulated genes associated with cell death, apoptosis, acute response to stress pathways underwent considerable down-regulation in the late post-injury period. Accordingly, the genes implicated in nervous tissue remodeling and neuron development, the regulation of synaptic transmission and the establishment of localization were substantially induced by the 3rd month. Collectively, our observations support the view that M\u00fcller glial cells might well play an active role not only in retinal cell reorganization following injury but potentially also in RPE regeneration, which appears to be the key event in retinal reparative process. Furthermore, we provided novel compelling evidence of the crucial role of neurotrophins in the pathophysiology of retinal repair and identified the signaling pathways that are activated during this process.", "tags": ["retina", "retinal"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["sodium iodate"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}, {"pmid": "2801350", "title": "[Pathologic response of the regenerated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)--affected by sodium iodate (NaIO3)].", "abstract": "Phagocytosis, proliferation and metaplasia to fibroblast-like cells in the regenerated retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE) were examined after damage caused by administration of sodium iodate.

One of its most important functions is the exchange of metabolites between the photoreceptors and RPE because photoreceptor cells have very high energy demands, largely satisfied by oxidative metabolism. The riboflavin (RF) cofactors, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), are two key cofactors involved in oxidative metabolism. We have previously shown that retbindin is a photoreceptor-specific RF-binding protein exclusively expressed in the rods and present in the interphotoreceptor matrix at the interface between the RPE and photoreceptor outer segments. Here, we show that retbindin ablation in mice causes a retinal phenotype characterized by time- and dose-dependent declines in rod and cone photoreceptor functions as early as 120 days of age. Whereas minor retinal ultrastructural defects were observed at all ages examined, a significant decline occurred in photoreceptor nuclei at 240 days of age (\u223c36.8% rods and \u223c19.9% cones). Interestingly, significant reductions in FAD and FMN levels were observed before the onset of degeneration (\u223c46.1% FAD and \u223c45% FMN). These findings suggest that the reduced levels of these flavins result in the disruption of intracellular mechanisms, leading to photoreceptor cell death.

This disease involves oxidative stress burden in the retina leading to death of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and photoreceptors. The retina is susceptible to oxidative stress, in part due to high metabolic activity and high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids that undergo lipid peroxidation chain reactions. Antioxidant enzymes exist in the retina to combat this stress, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 specifically reduces oxidized lipids, protecting against lipid peroxidation-induced oxidative stress, which is noted in dry AMD. We hypothesize that Gpx4 knockout within the RPE will result in an environment of chronic oxidative stress yielding degeneration akin to AMD. C57BL/6J mice with a floxed Gpx4 gene were mated with Rpe65Cre/ER mice. Offspring containing Rpe65Cre\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0alleles and either Gpx4 WT or Gpx4 fl/fl alleles were administered tamoxifen to induce Gpx4 knockout in Gpx4 fl/fl mice. At sequential timepoints, retinal phenotypes were assessed via in vivo imaging utilizing confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and visual function was probed by electroretinography. Retinas were studied post-mortem by immunohistochemical analyses, electron microscopy, plastic sectioning, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western analyses. The RPE-specific Gpx4 knockout model was validated via Western analysis indicating diminished GPX4 protein only within the RPE and not the neural retina. Following Gpx4 knockout, RPE cells became dysfunctional and died, with significant cell loss occurring 2 weeks post-knockout.

RPE65-/- mice were employed as a model of retinal degeneration. C57BL/6J mice were used as a wild-type control. OCT was performed on the RPE65-/- mice from postnatal day (P) 22 to 170. The longitudinal changes in the OCT images and fundus pictures were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison to those of C57BL/6J mice. The OCT images were also compared to the histological and electron microscopic findings. Full field combined rod and cone ERG was performed to analyze the relationship between morphology based on OCT and the amplitudes of the a- and b-waves. In the RPE65-/- mice, the photoreceptor rod and cone layer appeared as a diffuse hyperreflective zone contiguous with the inner segment ellipsoid zone (IS-EZ) on OCT, even on P22, whereas the IS-EZ and interdigitation zone were clearly identified in the age-matched C57BL/6J mice. The histological analyses revealed that the regular arrangement of the photoreceptor inner and outer segments was gradually lost in the RPE65-/- mice. On electron microscopy, most of the rod outer segments were degenerated from P21 to P35, whereas outer segments became variably shorter after P49 although ultrastructure appeared to normalize.

In addition, we aim to explore the effect of RPE source used for transplantation, the method of intervention, and the animal model which is used. In this study, we systematically identified all publications concerning transplantation of RPE in experimental animal models targeting the improvement of vision (e.g., outcome measurements related to the morphology or function of the eye).

This study involved the development of a monkey model of RD with controllable lesion sites, which can be rapidly prepared for the study of preclinical stem cell therapy among other applications. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in three doses was delivered into the monkey eye by subretinal injection (SI), and normal saline was applied as control. Structural and functional changes of the retinas were evaluated via multimodal imaging techniques and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) before and after the treatment. Histological examination was performed to identify the target layer of the affected retina. The health status of monkeys was monitored during the experiment. Well-defined lesions with various degrees of retinal degeneration were induced at the posterior pole of retina as early as 7 days after SNP SI. The damage of SNP was dose dependent. In general, 0.05 mM SNP caused mild structural changes in the retina; 0.1 mM SNP led to the loss of outer retinal layers, including the outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE); while 0.2 mM SNP impacted the entire layer of the retina and choroid. MfERG showed reduced amplitude in the damaged region. The structural and functional damages were not recovered at 7-month follow-up. A rapidly induced lesion site-controllable retinal degeneration monkey model was established by the subretinal administration of SNP, of which the optimal dose is 0.1 mM.

It has been shown that multiple cell death pathways are involved in the cell-specific effects of the toxins. Necrosis has been identified as the cause of the NaIO3-induced RPE loss.

However, recent research points to the additional involvement of caspase-independent processes as endoplasmic reticulum stress and calpain activation. Since there is still a substantial amount of contradictory hypotheses concerning triggers of cell death, the use of pharmacological models is controversial.

The RPE of MRL/MpJ and control AKR/J mice was injured by retro-orbital injection of sodium iodate at 20 mg/kg body weight, which titration studies indicated was optimal for highlighting strain differences in the response to injury. Five days after sodium iodate injection at this dose, electroretinography of both strains revealed equivalent retinal responses that were significantly reduced compared to untreated mice. At one and two months post-injection, retinal responses were restored in MRL/MpJ but not AKR/J mice. Bright field and fluorescence microscopy of eyecup cryosections indicated an initial central loss of RPE cells and RPE65 immunostaining in MRL/MpJ and AKR/J mice, with preservation of peripheral RPE. Phalloidin staining of posterior eye whole mounts confirmed this pattern of RPE loss, and revealed a transition region characterized by RPE cell shedding and restructuring in both strains, suggesting a similar initial response to injury. At one month post-injection, central RPE cells, RPE65 immunostaining and phalloidin staining were restored in MRL/MpJ but not AKR/J mice.

Together with its post-mitotic status and constant photooxidative damage from incoming light, the retina requires a tightly-regulated housekeeping system that involves autophagy.

A combination of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models were used to test the neuroprotective potential of UA in the SI model. Functional assays (OCT, ERGs), cellular analysis (flow cytometry, qPCR) and fine confocal microscopy (immunohistochemistry, tandem selective autophagy reporters) helped address this question. UA alleviated neurodegeneration and preserved visual function in SI-treated mice. Simultaneously, we observed severe proteostasis defects upon SI damage induction, including autophagosome accumulation, that were resolved in animals that received UA. Treatment with UA restored autophagic flux and triggered PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, as previously reported in the literature. Autophagy blockage caused by SI was caused by severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization. While UA did not induce lysosomal biogenesis, it did restore upcycling of permeabilized lysosomes through lysophagy. Knockdown of the lysophagy adaptor SQSTM1/p62 abrogated viability rescue by UA in SI-treated cells, exacerbated lysosomal defects and inhibited lysophagy.

Acid sphingomyelinase knockout (ASMase KO) mice were utilized to study the roles of this sphingolipid metabolizing enzyme in the retina. Electroretinogram and morphometric analysis were used to assess the retinal function and structure at various ages. Sphingolipid profile was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Western blots evaluated the level of the autophagy marker LC3-II. When compared to control animals, ASMase KO mice exhibited significant age-dependent reduction in ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes. Associated with these functional deficits, morphometric analysis revealed progressive thinning of retinal layers; however, the most prominent degeneration was observed in the photoreceptor and outer nuclear layer. Additional analyses of ASMase KO mice revealed early reduction in ERG c-wave amplitudes and increased lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Sphingolipid analyses showed abnormal accumulation of sphingomyelin and sphingosine in ASMase KO retinas. Western blot analyses showed a higher level of the autophagosome marker LC3-II.

The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between reduced autophagy and age-related degeneration of the RPE. The gene encoding RB1CC1/FIP200 (RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1), a protein essential for induction of autophagy, was selectively knocked out in the RPE by crossing Best1-Cre mice with mice in which the Rb1cc1 gene was flanked with Lox-P sites (Rb1cc1(flox/flox)). Ex vivo and in vivo analyses, including western blot, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and electroretinography were performed to assess the structure and function of the retina as a function of age. Deletion of Rb1cc1 resulted in multiple autophagy defects within the RPE including decreased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, accumulation of autophagy-targeted precursors, and increased numbers of mitochondria. Age-dependent degeneration of the RPE occurred, with formation of atrophic patches, subretinal migration of activated microglial cells, subRPE deposition of inflammatory and oxidatively damaged proteins, subretinal drusenoid deposits, and occasional foci of choroidal neovascularization. There was secondary loss of photoreceptors overlying the degenerated RPE and reduction in the electroretinogram.

We investigated the hypothesis that altered oxygen distribution across the retina and choroid could be involved in the vascular changes seen in this retinopathy. We compared measurements of vitreal, intraretinal, and choroidal oxygen tension (PO2) distribution in anesthetized and ventilated control and urethan-treated rats at 8 and 16 wk of age with the use of oxygen-sensitive microelectrodes. Striking differences were observed in both choroidal and intraretinal PO2 distribution in urethan-treated rats compared with controls. At both ages, intrachoroidal PO2 was much lower in the urethan-treated rats. In addition, the intraretinal PO2 distribution across the inner retinal layers was more uniform than normal. A small elevation in PO2 was present at 8 wk in the inner nuclear layer where subsequent vascular regression occurred, and a small reduction in PO2 was present at the RPE, which recovered to normal values by 16 wk in regions where RPE vessel networks were first evident. Although the retinal arteries were considerably thinner at both ages in the urethan-treated rats, the vitreal PO2 profiles and superficial retinal PO2 remained normal. The unexpected and large reduction in the oxygen delivery from the choroid found in the urethan-treated rats may account for the lack of major hyperoxia within the pathological retina and the lower oxygen tension in the RPE before the vascular proliferation in this region.

Intravenous (IV) administration of NaIO(3) up to 90 mg/kg had no effect on retinal function and 110 mg/kg was lethal. IV administration of IAA (5-20 mg/kg) produced concentration-dependent changes in visual function as measured by full-field and multi-focal electroretinograms (ffERG and mfERG), and 30 mg/kg IAA was lethal. The IAA-induced effects measured at two weeks were stable through eight weeks post-injection, the last time point investigated. IAA at 7.5, 10, and 12 mg/kg produce a concentration-dependent reduction in both ffERG b-wave and mfERG N1-P1 amplitudes compared to baseline at all post-injection times. Comparisons of dark- and light-adapted ffERG b-wave amplitudes show a more significant loss of rod relative to cone function. The fundus of swine treated with \u226510 mg/kg IAA was abnormal with thinner retinal vessels and pale optic discs, and we found no evidence of bone spicule formation. Histological evaluations show concentration-dependent outer retinal damage that correlates with functional changes. We conclude that NaIO(3,) is not an effective toxin in swine. In contrast, IAA can be used to create a rapidly inducible, selective, stable and concentration-dependent model of photoreceptor damage in swine retina.

In human ARPE-19 cells, we used Annexin V/PI staining to determine cell viability, immunoblotting to determine protein expression and signaling cascades, confocal microscopy to determine mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, and Seahorse analysis to determine mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We found that NaIO3 can dramatically induce cytosolic but not mitochondrial ROS production. NaIO3 can also activate ERK, p38, JNK and Akt, increase LC3II expression, induce Drp-1 phosphorylation and mitochondrial fission, but inhibit mitochondrial respiration. Confocal microscopic data indicated a synergism of NaIO3 and bafilomycin A1 on LC3 punctate formation, indicating the induction of autophagy. Using cytosolic ROS antioxidant NAC, we found that p38 and JNK are downstream signals of ROS and involve in NaIO3-induced cytotoxicity but not in mitochondrial dynamics, while ROS is also involved in LC3II expression. Unexpectedly NAC treatment upon NaIO3 stimulation leads to an enhancement of mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy and Akt further enhances cell susceptibility to NaIO3. We conclude that NaIO3-induced oxidative stress and cytosolic ROS production exert multiple signaling pathways that coordinate to control cell death in RPE cells.

This research is to evaluate the relationship between anthropometric measurements and AMD in the United States citizens in a cohort of patients. Our study included a cohort of 3,127 participants, all of whom were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted between 2005 and 2008. Various anthropometric indices, including weight (WT), waist circumference (WC), Body Mass Index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WtHR), circularity index (CI), weight-adjusted waist circumference index (WWI), body roundness index (BRI), a body size index (ABSI), and visceral adiposity index (VAI), have been studied extensively within public health and nutrition to assess body fat distribution. Odds ratios (OR) for each anthropometric index, in relation to AMD and its different stages, were computed, adjusting for confounding variables. Smoothed curve fitting, coupled with weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis, was used to examine the impact of these anthropometric measures on the prevalence of AMD. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to gender, age, BMI, drinking, smoking, CVD, diabetes, hypertension, cataract operation, and glaucoma.

In some experiments eye tissue was harvested and evaluated for FasL expression, macrophage influx by immunohistochemistry, and release of sFasL. RESULTS. Injection of cytotoxic FasL successfully prevented neovascularization in a mouse model of CNV. Oral doxycycline increased functional FasL in the eye and substantially inhibited neovascularization. Doxycycline treatment increased FasL expression on the RPE cells and reduced circulating and tissue-associated sFasL. Treatment was ineffective in B6-gld mice, demonstrating that CNV inhibition was mediated by FasL. CONCLUSIONS.

One eye of each rat underwent laser photocoagulation. The other eye served as normal control. After the laser treatment, the 64 rats were divided into four groups (n=16 in each group): Blank control group, in which no intravitreal administration was given; cyclopamine group, recombinant Shh N-terminals protein (rShh) group and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group, in which cyclopamine (a Shh inhibitor), rShh (a Shh activator) and PBS were intravitreally injected into the laser-treated eyes respectively every other day for a total of four intravitreal injections immediately after the laser treatment.

An efficacious number of implanted capsules to reduce CNV was identified. Expression of the fusion protein systemically did not elicit an immune response.

CNV volume was not suppressed by 16-nt siRNA-Luc injection (P = 0.7700). The mean VEGF protein level decreased significantly in the 21nt-siRNA-Luc- and 21nt-siRNA-Vegfa-injected eyes compared with PBS-injected eyes 3 days after laser photocoagulation (P = 0.0011, P = 0.0063, respectively).

Comparing water- and nicotine-fed mice, CNV size was 61% to 86% smaller in water-fed mice except for the \u03b1-bungarotoxin group, where there was no difference.

In addition, the laser-treated mice received systemic interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) therapy. Measurements of CNV lesions were acquired by the confocal analysis of stained choroidal flat mounts. The proportions of T helper 17 (Th17) cells were determined by flow cytometric analysis. A total of differentially expressed 186 genes (120 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated) and 104 proteins (73 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated) were identified. The gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that CNV was mainly associated with immune and inflammatory responses, such as cellular response to IFN-\u03b2 and Th17 cell differentiation. Moreover, the key nodes of the protein-protein interaction network mainly involved up-regulated proteins, including alpha A crystallin and fibroblast growth factor 2, and were verified by Western blotting. To confirm the changes in gene expression, real-time quantitative PCR was performed. Furthermore, levels of IFN-\u03b2 in both the retina and plasma, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were significantly lower in the CNV group than in the control group. IFN-\u03b2 treatment significantly reduced CNV lesion size and promoted the proliferation of Th17 cells in laser-treated mice.

Animals were treated 3 days before or after laser injury with recombinant TNF receptor P75 (etanercept, 5 microg/h, group 1, n = 12), chimeric monoclonal antibody (infliximab, 5 microg/h, group 2, n = 12) for 7 days by intraperitoneally implanted osmotic pumps.

The left eyes were removed for histopathologic examination and the right eyes were removed for flatmounts immunohistochemistry immediately after fluorescein angiography. In mice treated with medications 3 days before laser injury, left eyes were collected at 1 or 2 weeks after laser injury. In mice treated with medications 3 days after laser injury, left eyes were collected at 10 days after laser injury. CNV responses were compared by flatmount analysis of CNV-related fluorescence area and by determination of fluorescein angiographic leakage. The level of protein expression of TNF-alpha was semiquantitatively evaluated by Western blot analysis of the choroidal and RPE layer from mice with or without laser treatment. Western blotting demonstrated that TNF-alpha was highly expressed in choroidal and RPE cells of wild type mice 1 week after laser treatment as compared to the control mice without laser treatment. Etanercept and infliximab administrated 3 days before laser-damage significantly reduced CNV size and pathological fluorescein leakage in comparison to the control group one and two weeks after laser injury. Only etanercept administered 3 days after laser injury still significantly reduced the development of CNV lesions. Histopathological examination confirmed that CNV lesions in treated mice had smaller diameter and thinner center as compared to the control animals. Anti-TNF-alpha treatment reduces the size and leakage of laser-induced CNV.

The pathogenesis of new choroidal vessel formation is poorly understood. Although inflammation has been implicated in the development of CNV, the role of complement in CNV has not been explored experimentally. A reliable way to produce CNV in animals is to rupture Bruch's membrane with laser photocoagulation. A murine model of laser-induced CNV in C57BL/6 mice revealed the deposition of C3 and membrane attack complex (MAC) in the neovascular complex. CNV was inhibited by complement depletion using cobra venom factor and did not develop in C3(-/-) mice. Anti-murine C6 Abs in C57BL/6 mice inhibited MAC formation and also resulted in the inhibition of CNV. Vascular endothelial growth factor, TGF-beta2, and beta-fibroblast growth factor were elevated in C57BL/6 mice after laser-induced CNV; complement depletion resulted in a marked reduction in the level of these angiogenic factors. Thus, activation of complement, specifically the formation of MAC, is essential for the development of laser- induced choroidal angiogenesis in mice.

Thirty female Brown Norway rats underwent laser photocoagulation to induce CNV. Twenty of them (treatment group) were treated with a single intravitreal injection of 5 microg YC-1, and the remaining 10 (control) were sham-treated with a single intravitreal injection of 2.5 mg/ml dimethyl sulfoxide 2 weeks after laser photocoagulation. The expression of HIF-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CNV was evaluated by immunofluorescence staining. Fluorescein angiography was performed 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after single intravitreal YC-1 (5 microg) and dimethyl sulfoxide (2.5 mg/ml) injection, grading fluorescein leakage from 0 to 3. The size of the CNV was measured on histologic sections. Both HIF-1alpha and VEGF were expressed in CNV lesions in the control group 4 weeks after laser photocoagulation, whereas the expressions of HIF-1alpha and VEGF were not observed in the intravitreally YC-1-treated group.

Current anti-angiogenic treatments by VEGF sequestering agents have been successful, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond well to these treatments, and the response of others diminishes over time, suggesting that additional anti-angiogenic agents that function by separate mechanisms may be of use to such patients. We have previously found that a point mutated form of semaphorin-3E resistant to cleavage by furin like pro-protein convertases (UNCL-Sema3E) displays potent anti-angiogenic properties. We therefore determined if UNCL-Sema3E has potential as an inhibitor of CNV formation. We chose to study UNCL-Sema3E rather than wild type sema3E because unlike full length sema3E, the major p61-Sema3E peptide that is produced by cleavage of sema3E with furin like pro-protein convertases activates signal transduction mediated by the ErbB2 receptor and can promote tumor metastasis in addition to its anti-angiogenic activity. UNCL-Sema3E inhibited efficiently vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) signaling in human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells (HUVEC) and to a lesser extent hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signal transduction. CNV that was induced in the eyes of C57 black mice by laser photocoagulation was inhibited by 65% (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) following a single bolus intra-vitreal injection of 5\u00a0\u03bcg UNCL-Sema3E. This inhibitory effect was similar to the inhibition produced by a single bolus intra-vitreal injection of 5\u00a0\u03bcg aflibercept. A similar inhibition of CNV was observed following the injection of UNCL-Sema3E into the eyes of Long-Evans rats. However, a higher dose of UNCL-Sema3E (125\u00a0\u03bcg), partially due to the larger volume of the vitreous cavity of rats, was required to achieve maximal inhibition of CNV. Injection of UNCL-Sema3E into eyes of healthy mice did not have any adverse effect on retinal function as assessed by optic kinetic reflex (OKR) or by electroretinogram (ERG) assays nor did UNCL-Sema3E injection affect the structure of the retina as determined using histology.

Since the majority of activity in the common terminal pathway results from engagement of the amplification loop, the alternative pathway has been proposed as a logical therapeutic target. We recently generated a factor H (fH)-based complement inhibitor (CR2-fH) with the capacity to be \"targeted\" to sites of complement C3 activation. We asked whether the human therapeutic (TT30) is effective in a mouse model of AMD. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was induced by argon laser photocoagulation of Bruch's membrane. Every other day, mice received intravenous injections of TT30 or vehicles, and after 6 days, the presence or absence of CNV and CNV-related changes were evaluated. Area of CNV, photoreceptor cell function, gene expression for complement components and cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels, and TT30 bioavailability were determined. CNV development, which has previously been shown to require local complement activation, could be reduced by intravenous TT30 delivery. Specific inhibition of the alternative pathway not only reduced angiogenesis in CNV, but also ameliorated changes in several associated disease-related biomarkers, including diminished retinal function and molecular events known to be involved in AMD such as VEGF production. After intravenous injection, TT30 localized to CNV lesion sites in the retinal pigmented epithelium-choroid. Systemic administration of TT30 was found to reduce CNV pathology.

There are 2 classes of AMD, wet-type and dry-type. Wet-type involves excess angiogenesis around the macula, referred to as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This can result in leaky vessels, often causing more severe vision loss than dry-type AMD. Adiponectin peptide 1 (APNp1) has been shown to slow the progression of CNV. Here, we used a mouse model and FITC-labeled APNp1 to determine if APNp1 could be delivered effectively as an eye drop. Our experiment revealed that topically applied FITC-APNp1 could reach the macula of the eye, which is crucial for treating wet-type AMD. We also tested delivery of APNp1 via injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector in a mouse model of CNV. AAV is a harmless virus easy to manipulate and is very often used for protein or peptide deliveries. Results revealed an increase in the expression of APNp1 in the retina and choroid over a 28-day period. Finally, we investigated the mechanism by which APNp1 affects CNV by examining the expression of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the retinal and choroidal tissue of the mouse eyes. AdipoR1 and PCNA were overexpressed in these tissues in mice with laser-induced CNV compared to na\u00efve mice. Based on our data shown here, we think it will enhance our understanding of APNp1 as a therapeutic agent for wet-type AMD and possible treatment alternatives that could be more beneficial for patients.", "tags": ["macular", "retina", "retinal", "age-related macular degeneration", "choroidal neovascularization"], "paper_type": "Mechanism Study", "drug_names": ["Adiponectin peptide 1 (APNp1)"], "trial_phase": "Not applicable"}]
